loot kr kisi ka bhala nahi hua to inka kya hoga i found it good from breakfast or snack point of view the taste was good the tadka was mild and not overly spicy the idli felt freshly steamed and fried just quantity can be improved a bit for the quoted amount 3rd class quality food and the owner dont even hesitate for their mistake got stale and smelly rice food was rotten best riderrr 💕💕💕 hats off what they show doesn’t match with deliver food not good smell is very bad taste was goodbut chapati was burned and spring rolls were littli hard to chew i ordered shehwan noodles and they are goodbutww improve the packaging awesome roti jali hui hai refund do quantity is too low and desert is missing bland taste too salty not fresh at all very bad experience at the restaurant just overhyped the food is like any street cart one of the coolest place of bhopal those who serve good food too i loved the corn cheese rolls and the pasta here the ambiance is great if you are planning to throw a small party this is the place the small shacks are good idea overall okay i went for the first time paneer sushi in general was good but one cant say its sushi siya chaap was nice daal makhani and paneer kadhai along with tandoori roti all good nachos with baked beans was a turn off they baked nachos as well and brought each nacho separately it was burnt as well brwe asked them that this is not made like this staff is courteous another thing is service is too slow we waited atleast 15 mins for starters n half hr for main course when we paid bill after that finger bowl came this area really needs improvementbrrest i would recommend as place is little different with nice natural view 5 stars for food 5 stars for ambience but worst worst service you can ever expect its not that service is bad on peaks hours or at weekends at any time of the day waiters are never intrested your food may take hours amazing place one of the few places where i have loved having vegetarian food toobrbrwe orderedbr1 paneer patiala main coursebr2 paneer tikka tawa masalabr3 bhindi kurmuribr4 ariyali vegbr5 guava ice creambrbrif you like this review follow me on instagram for more mouth

was also tooo goodbr visited the restaurant on cworded sunday evening food was good however services were extremely poor management seemed incapable to operate had to literally shout very time to get attention of waiter had to ask 3 times to get spoons that too only 2 spoons for 3 people had finished half of meal by then had same experience while reordering had to wait for good 20 mins to get refile of chapatis same thing was happening with nearby tables finally had to walk to the reception to ask for bill since was not in mode to spoil rest of the evening will suggest anyone visiting to bring their own cutlery and waiter went to 32degrees with family on our anniversary they made our day very special amazing decoration with lovely relaxed ambience its a pure veg family restaurant had

pennybr4 tip top rolls it has spinach cheese and some exotic veggies and is very much tastybr5 paneer yaki tori cream japanese cusinie rich in its flavours and soft melts as it goes in your mouth highly recommendedbrbroverall the place and staff us very good in the night the place looks marvelous and a more like a fairytale type quality of food was very low and taste was horrible also the location of the restaurant is in outskirts which is not recommended if you are going with family no parking space no proper road from highway to restaurant this place located on the outskirts of the city is best to hang around with friends and even family the cute lil huts will catch your eyes the place has been festooned really nicely and youll love every bit of the creative ambience coming to the food parta bit improvement in few of the dishes is needed their sizzlers and honey chilli potato are tasty and id recommend that since i am a freaking alfredo pasta fan the one i had here didnt meet my expectations rest assured the service is great and the place is good for birthday parties they have decor service as well very nice ambience amazing place to hangout with friends not a good option with family though hukkah is also served here food quality and quantity is also good price also does justice with the quality of food served herebrbrtheir pasta is a must try amazing place to

nyc pakoda with teacake is fantabulousnyc staffgood atmospherenyc decorationmust visit place for dinner etc we were pretty hyped about this place given the quirky name but the food was such a let down we tried the paneer sushi which the staff highly recommended and also because paneer sushi in itself sounds like an interesting thing to eat what it turned out to be is a crossover between a spring roll and vegetable salad tastewise it wasnt too bad but it definitely wasnt a sushi by miles we also had a tangerino a drink that was again suggested by the staff nothing much to write about it it was just like any mocktail made with artificial flavours the ambience of the place is amazing thats why 2 stars for it seems like a cool hangout for college students cleanliness not so much the bathroom

ongoing pandemic been here on a cold nd breezy saturday eveand this place has won my heartbran awesome ambience with more awesome foodbrnever thought of like this place in bhopal they have made the

its an open space so great for dates and casual hang outs being polite and not hateful the ambience is good but we expect a good response and food when hungrybrpathetic service and being an outerdoor cafe no arrangement for summers waiters assume that someone is attending the table the staff tries to act responsible when about to leave left without ordering anything 😑 personal favourite the ambience food service everything is just great specifically a fan of their manchurian dry and pasta highly recommended this is one of my favorite places in bhopal the ambiance is amazing i love the fact that you can have your privacy while you come here which is all thanks to the way the seating arrangements have been made i think this place is good even if you are going out with family so its not specifically an all young generation place brbr they serve shessha and the food is also amazing they have great variety in menu also the presentation of food is good the staff is cordial and helping brbri have just two reasons why i have not given it a 5 on 5 one being that alcohol is not available i sure wish that was done as sometimes when you just want to quiet place to chill and drink i dont see many such options in bhopal for the same the second reason being when you come here with family or small kids it is difficult for them to climb up because of the stairs and its also a little scary with them though they also have options to sit at other places but since the place is mostly crowded gets difficult sometimes perfect place for an outing aesthetic interior amazing food with lots of options unique menu of fusion food satisfies the taste buds fast service and humble staff ambience is good but taste is very okayish not worth the hype ordered french fries but they were

ruin your day waste your money spoil your taste bud and wait for long hours you should totally visit this placebri went with a bunch of people to celebrate my husbands bday and it was a total disaster we received our starters 4045 mins after order and main course didnt arrive for more than 90 mins after we placed our order when we decided to walk out asking them to cancel our order and bill for the food we actually had their ownermanager came rushing to us and started convincing us saying that our food is ready and we should have it we kept on telling him that we have other commitments yet he didnt budge and forced us to have the food saying its on the house which actually wasnt brcoming onto the foodbrwe ordered boti soya chaap and afghani soya chaap which were both a blot to what we usually get in delhi next we ordered crispy corn which wasnt crispy at all it was anything but crispy corn baked bean nachos were extremely soggy and distasteful chaanch was just thick curd with lots of corriander leaves and spicesbrkurkuri bhindi was so pathetic that an ideal kurkuri bhindi might just want to commit suicide after seeing it the list is long since we were very enthusiastic about trying this place and food but in a nutshell everything about this place except for its outdoor setup is a huge let down and total waste of your time and money staff isnt courteous and polite at all management and service sucks staying home and making yourself a bowl of boiled maggie is far a better option than visiting this good for nothing place these noodles which look like glass are famous as glass noodles 🍜brthis tempting dish is known as japchae it is a sweet and savory dish of stirfried glass noodles and vegetables that is popular in korean cuisinebrbranother one is paneer sushi its

authentic dish of korea brit was made out of paneer coated with sesame seeds which was scrumptious kimchi a staple in korean cuisine is a traditional side dish made from salted and fermented vegetables most commonly cabbage and korean radishes with a variety of seasonings this can be a favourite dish among the ones who love to eat spicy food brthis is the only restaurant who is serving

they have machan everywhere to sit there are trees everywhere giving you that peaceful and calm vibes a place away from city’s life and is quite serenebrbrtalking about their food they serve variety of indian continental chinese and asian cuisine very few places serve such variety of food in town this is one of them sharing my experience of dishes i have tried therebrbr01 layered baebelino this was a mocktail it had dark pink red color this was basically combination of blueberry crush and cranberry juice i found it a little more sweeter than it should have been rest the flavours of blueberry and cranberry coming off good a refreshing drink indeedbrbr02 paneer sushi this was something new to me as i have never heard of paneer sushi before though it wasn’t something like authentic sushi but they have moderated sushi as per local taste there were small roles which were made of cornflour and later stuffed with vegetables and grated cottage cheese it was then topped with cheese i liked this sushi it had a mild tastebrbr03 bangkok bread croquettes a croquette is basically a small breadcrumbed fried roll containing meat fish etc but again they have moderated it and made the indian version of it breadcrumbed fried rolls were stuffed with mashed veggies and cottage cheese and served in thick red gravy this had a good taste brbr04 chaap platter one of my favourite from the evening they served 4 different variety of chaap in a small rail engine shaped thing i really like the presentation the platter had desi chaap achari chaap afghani chaap and boti chaap all the chaaps were perfectly cooked also the chaaps are made from soyabean it was served with green mint chutney and onions highly recommendbrbr05 white sauce pasta penne pasta which was cooked in white sauce along with veggies like broccoli bell peppers etc was creamy and rich it had mild flavour and had a decent tastebrbroverall this is a nice place to hangout with your friends family or anyone a place which is

all was good but the khichadi should be less spicy tasty good packing great food good portion size and value for money 🤩🤩 never order from this restaurant poor quality and quantity is also not good its just a suggestion if you wish to apply adding a spoon will give an advantage and lesser oily would increase food quality worse food i have ever tasted no quality very bad packing and they send different from what i order and did not pick up my call or did anything zomato should ban such restaurant which cheet customers food was good but delivery took forever great taste proper hygiene and always fresh br amazing food too much spicy i cant eat it order lollipop and received chilly chicken bakwas khana very clean and fresh and delicious food 😋 very little excellent delivery is delayed by an hour this is not fair at all didn’t expect this quality butter chicken and biryani combo is really great quantity was also good for two people order delayed by resturant too spicy foodworthlessand who will make cabbage in vegetable menu only paratha recive no dahi pic me dahi dikha kar dhoka dete he or call karke puchne par bhi juth bolte he no good jala hua ye paratha sife zomato jese gatiya app he chala sakte he or in jese bakwas resturent pehli baar me itni achhi quantity aur quality di 2nd time me bewakuf bana dia poor food qualitybrvery bad chicken fried rice was only filled wid chillies n was tastelessnot worthy at all had a nice dinner herekeep up the good work not good no taste only 2 big lollipops rest of them were very small nice restaurant everyone should try it bakbas baked veggie has no proper quantity of saucewe have not been delivered garlic bread the accompaniment with iti called u upthe person said they have no such order pizza is of thin crest which is not mentioned in menu frequent visitor food quality and ambience is top notch i ordered chicken kathi roll but received paneer kathi roll instead kulche kachche the chole is half not sufficient as per qty package quality is worst oil was spreaded everywhere ordered chicken lollipop in images the dish was dry but we received the dish with gravy portion was too little sent eclairs because they did not have a pyramid the cream was stale and smelling bad the quality of amer has deteriorated a lot bad experience thanks for the delicious cake dishes got bit less hot by the time it reached us paneer used is adulterated red velvet and triple layer pastry were stale and rock hard they tasted very bad we had to throw them away stale pastry cant believe abh sent this kind of food shame on u bowl of dal and paneer was half filled cream rolls have been one of the most appreciated products from amer bakery hut for more than 20yrs but for the past two times the quality has been poor the whipped cream filled inside was over beaten and it felt as if the rolls were stale brhighly disappointed there was no spoon or fork undercooked ricetotally kachcha home food for the family celebrations this is the second time i am getting an extremely sour tasting eclair what has amer come to if it consecutively sends bad items great food with nice packaging 😃 chicken used was old and the gravy was not tasting good please maintain your standard you cant make a mess up the cake while icing the name that is such a basic thing got chilli chicken instead of paneer this is highly unacceptable especially on a diwali night and to top that we are pure vegetarians so that was totally unacceptable ready to go to consumer forum if restaurant doesnt redeem and accept their mistake good taste good atmosphere loving place must visit abh bittan market mr anil bhargav is polite and good natured also good behaviour lesser size receivednot of 500g as per the order cold cheese roll was rotten brdid not expect this out of abh tomato soup was amazing must try food got cold chilli chicken or chicken manchurian wrong order deliveredsecond time in a rowrude staff behaviour when inquired for wrong order after eating this i got stomach infection— dish was prepared day back may be bro mashroom kha h soup me the cake which has been delivered is damaged the spring rolls came in plastic and very soggy cake received in damaged condition worst experience i got shamed in front of my friend for whom i ordered it the cake was totally spilled secondly the taste was not even 50 what it was before there was no bread in peeper chicken as shown in picture third class soup both broccoli and mushroom i should have rather consumed salt mixed in water different frm photo u posted without beans i like very much food prepared as per my request i was delivered a non vegetarian item inspite of ordering paneer and nobody has responded yet bread that accompanies this is missing so basically i received just half of the item also taste is so bland so disappointed it tasted like bread used was very old it tasted very bad it was the worst muffin i ever had it was dry and stale so pathetic stale pastry and eclairs half portion of normal breadno trace of chicken only onions and capsicumvery poor nice 👌 box was damage and food taste was not good not at all value for money not at all worth👎 so bad delivery spoiled the mood the size of the pizza is suddenly smaller and they didnt seal the french fries the packet was open the burger was good not satisfied with the chilli chicken taken time the rajma they served was not quality after eating we have food poisoning tea cake was good but my father loves the pineapple cake but this time the quantity of pineapple was extremely low dont know if it was just this piece or they have reduced the overall quantity but what was expected was not fulfilled banana nahi aata to kyu apne menu me add kiya he the staff was extremely polite the service was very good but washroom hygiene needs attention you lack consistency ive been ordering chicken shawarma since a while but its a hit or miss mostly a miss maybe you keep changing your chef or what the issue is but the bread is so so soooo dry that you cant swallow it so much dry aata or maida on the rotibread that your hands get covered in it i threw the shawarma today it was that bad good food and ambience perfect for an evening hangout with friends i have received wrong order i ordered for exotica with olives onion mushrooms broccoli but i received something else its not like i am ordering this for the first time you can check your records i ordered this many times but it seems like the chef has changed or something happened brbrno taste made the dinner super frustratingbrbri would like a refund for this it seems like theyve reduced the amount of chicken they put in the pizza but it still tastes damn good quick fix for a thin crust pizza nice dish just a went a little much on lemon otherwise it was nice garage pasta without any saucebrdry like hellbrnever order too oily worst shawarma i ever had asked for chicken fried ricedelivered schezwan rice the pesto pasta was terrible just because the pasta is green does not make it pesto fried rice packaging was aweful quality of material was bad spoiled food delivered the food was good in taste i loved it but the portion was very very less … and its was very less for the price charged noodles are two peanuty and sweet no proper sealed packaging both were delicious br1 star deducted for packaging delicious food it mentioned that this fried rice will have egg in it but they didnt put any egg why everyone makes mistakes so when i saw an item added to my bill that i never ordered i sent the restaurant a message asking them to explain it they never responded which makes me wonder if that addition was intentional anyway would highly recommend you check the bill before leaving this establishment oh and that number i messaged is operational i called them on it to confirm their location before visiting food was good though really loved 😍😋 their pizza bri feel its the best pizza in bhopal best asian food in bhopal the food was totally burnt worst experience first they didnt send the pizza with my order then they took more than an hour to deliver it for a distance that can be covered in 5mins that too in cold chilled condition the pita bread used wasnt fresh it was a bit brittle even the taste is not the same as it was before need to work on the same not satisfied the sauce felt like eating raw tomatoes fired rice was spoiled and chicken was also felt stale even i asked my frnd to taste it to confirm and he also had same feeling this so bad i am so hungry this happens to me i am feeling so frustrated right now i want a refund chicken pieces were not good quantity and aroma is good but it was very spicy and even my kid who lives biryani was not able to eat due to high spice order not complete i dont usually

good the food was so spicy and the rice was sour and tasted spoiled food was good but for packaging black plastic is used which is very harmful excellent these days everytime i have ordered biryani

its ok type taste was not good poo tasty and yummy food prepared after taking my choice of spiceness which i forgot to feed while order on time preparation😍 fish was rotten amazing but veg was not so

in both but both had sugar asked not to add lettuce even called the restaurant still added it taste very below average its good though i wish the aglio e olio was made with spaghetti or linguini instead and for the portion size to be larger i also am hoping that youll return the spaghetti carbonara to you menu sometime hopefully this time with an additional mushroom option in place of chicken

go there again good place delicious food available here especially the veg biryani i ate hereonly service is bit late otherwise a great restaurant to visit👍 black mamba is exactly how it sounds it’s shady and all cramped up it’s nauseatingly annoying since the place is really small hence gets packed easily may be get rid off unwanted decorations to clear up some space another thing that they could definitely work on is the lighting i’m sure it would immensely improve the ambiance awsome placelarge space for partyingawsome dj bfull pub safe for girlsawsome food plus best club in bhopal with awsome sound system and bfull interior food served is stale and staff is very rude especially the gatekeepersbrone has to wait decades before being served so if you love your time and money dont visit this place this is one of the pathetic place you will ever like to get in i arranged a party for around 40 people including food and dj my guest was treated very badly there by the bouncer standing on the gate and the manager didnt even bother to look into the matterbrfood quality was not very good and the way it was served was pathetic though they mention that starters are unlimited but the moment party start they started cribbing on supplying food brvery rude and cheap customer service if you thinking to get in there for party or spending some quality time change you mood though its not that classy but would love to say its ok ok place wise its fine nice ambiance wasnt that full what i liked its cool to chill staff are really nice just lack of knowledge but overall great had a full bottle of wine in an hour service was bit slow but rest everything was fab the best part is dj❤ food was tastyand no floor charge that makes this palce awesomefor the edm loverspartyanimalsthis

staffs are not supporting they permitted smoking inside the pub and i was complaining to tell stop smoking to visitors but they refused and told me you can go back and get your refund really worst experience to visitbr pub with my siblings first time i am from indore i visited almost pubs in indore and didnt see any complications their but at black mamba i am not preferring any one to visit with their love ones blue lagoon deserves 10 stars for the ambience i went after lunch and stayed until sunset everything they have constructed feels very natural and is at par with greenery around it they have made multiple dining areas food was average not accepting zomato bookings tge starter where good but tge main course took 40 mins to come and was average the tomato soup was a waste of money no proper management listed in zomato but not accepting zomato offers behad ghatiya service we had a really bad experience in dining with blue lagoonthe serving staff was ok but the people at the billing counter manager and a guy they refused to pay the bill through zomato however the restaurant is listed in zomato and it had 15 off if you pay the bill from zomato they said you only get the offer if you book table but that discount is different and this is a diff offer of 15 we had to pay the full bill i request zomato not to list this kind of restaurants as this will create a huge trust issue for zomato itself i would never recommend this restaurant to any one and friends who used to come here will definelty share this experience good place but pathetic service my waiter atik khan we reached the location at 900 in the evening and waited for 2 hours to get starters and left at 1100 without having main course atik wasnt even allowing us to leave the place he called four boys at gate worst experience ever the owner should look into the matter at earliestbrzomato should take down them from dine out booking as they only want to promote their restaurant but are not ready to let us pay from zomato gold very bad place brdo not refund zomato 30 offbrabusive staff very bad service nice place to go with friends and family zomato par listed to hain par booking me nakhre dikhate hain jaise taise booking le bhi li to service itni bekar dete hain ki saamne wala uth kar chala jaye aur inka discount bach jaye areee bhai jab discount dene ki haisiyat nahi hai to list kyu kar rakha hai zomato par hata do waha se phokat me zomato ki bejjati ho rahi aur dusre restaurants ki booking pe bhi shanka hoti hai one of the worst dinner we had there service was very worst no steward was there even no one asked for glass of water brpoor managment service is slow last weekend i visited this place to celebrate my cousin birthday party heres service is good and staff are really friendly with their customers if you are looking for good service and friendly staff restaurant then must visit this place everything was excellent i had a great day with my family at boscos ❤ pita bread was completely stale very disappointing cold pizza base was flavourless and chewy toppings were not good either food is absolutely delicious i highly recommend this place quantity is extremely large and the tastiest burgers ever vegetarian dish me chicken piece nikla n we ask to chef about it he accept ke he do always chiken piece nikal ke rice serve karta hy daily my 5th time and they ruined it this place had my heart but this last visit to them they have forced me to make it my last service sub par while i wanted to speak to my attender he was more interested in keeping his tray food has changed from what they launched to now it has definitely changed unfortunately for the worse veg biryani was wet beyond liking simple salted fries were super oily all the while they tried to make me understand that salan is never provided with biryani and i kept thinking if i was hallucinating about eating salan with the same veg biryani the week they had launched sad ending aglio polio spaghetti was too oily the bread was fresh though unlike last time and i appreciate that i really liked the exotic veg pizza thin crust was properly made although it had gone cold by the time it reached me but i just wanted to taste and the taste of the sauce and fried basil was really good 5 star for pizza but 2 star for aglio polio it was just too oily dude kudos to the team sumptuous food and quick service size is very small you should mention its weight in menu also its not even 10 of what you show in the picture you just spoiled a birthday present it was awesome 👍 its good but nothing special expect pretty much the same as any other decent continental cafe in bhopal the food was the worst chicken was not cooked well lettuce was not fresh and mushrooms were also not cooked well 😞😞bri ate so many times at the restaurant and it was the best experience but i dont know why they didnt maintain the same food here on zometo ordered 5 items received only 1 first time ordered fraud restaurant good ambience and food found insect the manager was literally smiling and saying sorry they were resistant even when i asked them to call the chef to show him this and the chef said i washed it i dont know how it came unbelievable awesome food and ambience 😍👍 the food was delicious and nice presentation too kabab in particular was very nice loved the live music and italian background music too overall nice vibe pizza arrived cold but reheated in my air fryer nd it was bomb probably best thin crust pizzas in bhopal as of now not upto the mark more chimchuri needed on the fish for flavour less tangy on the chicken was expected neither biscoff nor cheesecake wonderfull experience 🙏 thankyou good food i loved ur restaurant n pasta wen i first came over i loved the hand written note this tym with my parcel thank u weve eaten here a few times and every time the food has been delicious well portioned and fresh the service is great and the cocktails are nice as well highly recommend pasta is to die for thank you i am visiting last night with my friends and ill order exotic veg pizza mandi rice or mocktails was excellent and great service thanx boscos to having me great evening 👍👍👍 food quality is good nice food pizza is authenticbrbao is really really goodbrfive spice chicken is the best i have in chinese style chickenbrtotally worth the price br the packaging quantity and especially the taste of the food is of excellent qualitybrthe lamb stew is absolutely flawless parmesan potato gnocchi and veg manti dumplings were really good i was expecting atleast 6 pieces but got only 5 but the taste was really good aranchini balls were tasteless but it was good with the sauce provided so i am giving it a 4 star it was really a good experience made me remember little italy ristorante might order in the future or visit this place thanks for food fish and chips were really good however the fish could have been fresher and the quantity of tarter sauce could have been increased though i still enjoyed it brbri did not enjoy chicken bao the ingredients were good but the only thing i could taste was the intense spice you def need to tone down on the spice level and that is from someone who can handle spice easily brbr loved the chicken steak superbbrmandi not that much need to work on packaging wonderful 😘😘😊 experience pita bread was not fresh it was stale a mixed bag of magic and disappointmentbrbras a regular patron since this restaurant first opened its doors i’ve always had a soft spot for its unique ambiance and oncedistinctive menu that set it apart from other places in bhopal however my experience on august 17 2024 left much to be desiredbrbrlet’s start with the positives the atmosphere last night was nothing short of magical the evening was elevated by two incredible musicians—a lady with a voice that could melt even the most stressedout diner and a male vocalist who also played the guitar with effortless charm their performances were the highlight of the night creating an enchanting vibe that frankly saved the evening from being a complete letdownbrbrnow onto the notsopleasant parts the service was disappointingly slow a stark contrast to the efficient and attentive experience i’ve come to expect from this place the wait times were unreasonable and the food which once stood out as innovative and flavorful was lackluster at best the flavors seemed to have lost their punch and the dishes now resemble what you’d find at any other mediocre spot in townbrbrto make matters worse the cocktails were downright bad they lacked the balance and creativity that used to make them a standout on the menu it’s as if the passion and attention to detail that once characterized this place have gradually faded awaybrbri couldn’t help but notice that the familiar faces who used to manage the restaurant with such care and professionalism were nowhere to be seen only a couple of staff members from the early days seem to still be around and the difference in management quality is painfully apparentbrbrin summary while the restaurant still has the potential to shine—especially with talented performers like the ones last night—the overall experience is slipping i’m giving a higher rating mainly because of the magical atmosphere created by the singers but i sincerely hope the management takes this as a wakeup call to bring back the charm that made this place special in the first place otherwise it risks being overshadowed by the new spots that are rapidly gaining popularity in bhopal a very good thick and chocolatey shake i loved it so much really really worth paying 😉 it tasted and looked like noodles that too a bit raw loved the coffee it didnt taste like pesto pasta i was really disappointed i had to throw it the cafe is really cute and cozy the coffee is amazing loved going there nice cozy restaurant tried their cappuccino iced latte cheese omelette and wraps coffee was perfect and delicious food at good pricing thank you for the cold coffee which was supposed to be hot and the dry sandwich which was half wet as the coffee and sandwich came in the same packing chia seeds have always needs to put soaked that is mandatory but the restaurant did not follow it not worth it i m sandwich lover so i m super happy with the quantity n quality of food 😌 😋 roti hard thi aur moti bhi thi not soft n fresh good food good test good quantity value for money 👍😊 you have to seal pack your parcel orders properly brpizza tastes good sandwich is too salty authenetic taste i ever had in bhopal i tried hakka noodles and chef suggested cheesy baked pasta hospitality is awosome taste can be done better very bland taste brpoor packing white sauce pasta is not good testy food quantity is very less its too tasty only part is is that its a bit spicy but overall the quantity and taste is awesome bakwas test wast money amazing taste and sufficient quantity comes super hot impressed with food and hospitality white sauce pasta was pathetic dont know where the sour taste was coming fromand the smell was irritating me🤮🤮 untasty food on taste not good and not bad non tasty best taste in bhopal so

was as terrible as expected filled with a snooty crowd not worth a visit aesthetic use of colours and materials in interior workbrvery peaceful ambiancesmiling faces arounda very good addition in bhopal sitoutskeep it up hands down the best place in town for desserts should work on a more expansive collection of cheesecakes because they’re really good here love the ambience in the vibe amado is one of the few places in bhopal which gets the premium cafe right the food is great and the vibe is nice the only downside might be that the portion sizes are small relative to the price nice cefe nice the cafe is superb it looks like fine dining i had iced latte and it was amazing the staff is polite and helpful they have dessert section which looks tempting amazing cafe food was great but desserts were the best part along with some nice coffee this is unique cafe for india brreally impressed with their service and friendly attitude highly recommended for family and friends get together parties br the place is extremely beautiful the menu is vast having continental cuisine the pasta and desserts are just too good i tried their aglio olio and biscoff cheesecake will return to try more

presentation sufficient quantity of food items and of course soma tea was available thats a plus one from my personal self one of the finest cafe in bhopal the food was really good and the ambience was awesome i liked the hygiene maintained by the staff brhighly recommended first that the portion size is too small then they are asking to go and order at the counter even for our third order which really put us off had it been a fast service and decent portion size restaurant then counter ordering would have been okay great coffee brbest hot chocolate in the city brlove their burrito bowl the food is great the menu is very new and interesting the ambience is also great do not miss the coffee toffee crumble pie and sour dough platter nice cafe nice cafe mood fresh 👌 i went there on saturday

pizzakesari pista cookies donald and more item is tooooo yammi fresh and nice service i absolutely love it one of the rare places that offers you authentic italian and continental food in bhopal lovely ambience with a european theme which adds a nice cozy feel to it in all a premium authentic restaurant in bhopal we went there and they just ignored us for 4045mins also suggested us to sit at the side high table as the cafe is full whereas i called them 10mins before coming there they said yes we can get a table then after waiting for 1hr we had to ask for one glass of water when we complained they calmly said that they were out of glasses to serve us water please food was average but seriously experience is very bad even from the cash counter itself best of cafe the place is good to hang out with friends or go on a date the ambience is very nice food served was fresh and delicious rates are high the more you go the more you will love this place it is the best place for coffee lovers friends and family it usually gets very busy in the evenings the food menu is vast and the dessert display is beautiful it has some amazing food drinks and desserts the ambience is beautiful the vibe of this place is amazing they have beautiful ambience food and coffee are excellent after a lot of recommendations visited this cafe and it didnt stand up to expectations ordered pizza and it took 3o mins to serve it that too on a weekday and the pizza was average no taste in the pizza pathetic no one is bothered to serve you water and service is pathetic they first bring the food then they bring the plates lmao visibility from the road is not good no signboard nothing only the ambiance is good best cafe in bhopal i had chocolate mousse glass and i must say it was amazing nice cafe amado has a nice ambience and a location thats unbeatable debatable but lets not go there as this is a review not a place to fight but is the ambience just enough to guarantee a good time read ahead to find outbrbri visited this place with a friend of mine we had lunch in our minds so amado was the place of choice 1 for the location its located in the heart of arera colony the ambiance is quite comforting and boho they did go all out in decorating the place to give it a freespirited look brbrbeing italian food enthusiasts we got ourselves a plate full of penne in alfredo sauce plus the three pepper chipotle cottage cheese pizza with an additional request to spice up the pizza sauce a bit which the folks didnt comply with eventually to accompany the food we got 2 drinks pictured one hazelnut frappe and an iced tea of some sort i dont really remember the name of itbrbrcoming to the taste of the food the pizza sauce was underseasoned and the base turned soggy by the time it reached our table the toppings were not seasoned and we were surprisingly greeted by raw veggies to make things better or worse you decide the pasta sauce alfredo was a bummer we instructed to make sure that theres no dryness to the pasta and the pasta to be cooked to perfection but the pasta was on the dryer side the frappé was bittersweet the way it should be and the iced tea was okay as per my compadrebrbroverall id give this place a generous 35 🌟s thank you for reading if youve made it this farbrbrp s coming to the prices we paid 600 per person 12k ish for 4 items had a terrible service they assigned us waiting area table rather then giving us new vacant tables they made new arriving people sit there instead of us after me asking a few times they gave us a table but in sometime made us share table with others which they said will be for two minutes but as it turned out the other party completed their meal at our table and then leftme and my friend were very uncomfortable with the other people on the table so we waited for the other party to leave before ordering after our meal we asked staff to get leftover pasta packed as more than half was left they asked us to vacate table and to wait while they brought the package after waiting sometime on asking we find out that they didn’t pack anything and were not even apologetic towards it on speaking to the manager he apologised but the food was wasted with no compensation on their part needless to say it was our last trip to the cafe awesome place for hangoutkeep up team amado wonder why the rating is so low deserves 45 star rating on zomato wonderful food wonderful beverages amazing ambience good service prosbrdessertsbrstaffbrambiencebrbrconsbrfood outright bad best cafe in bhopal 1 aestheticsperfectbr2music horrible as there are no sound absorbers the music was noise to ears br3foodbrordered a veg lasagna which was good in taste but very small in serve brsimilarly drinks were also very small in serve brpizza tasted horriblebroverall very average experience literally the worst place in bhopal no manners and etiquettes by staff illiterate illmannered staff when i wanted to place the order they mentioned it was prepaid i was taken aback but i paid thinking it might be their policy but people on other tables were given the bill after they had the food this was sheer insult when i called the manager he started making nonsense excuses and then said waiters had to pay from their pocket because some customers leave without paying thats the service theyre going to give you average cafe people thinking extremely highly of themselves visited this place 34 times every time noticed when ever we ask the waiter to take order they deny by saying please place the order on the reception and saw the same waiter taking orders next tables not just from one table taking orders from 34 tables and straight away denied to take out order felt so bad that we left the place after placing the order and not eating the food the food was great must try fruity blend green tea guacamole toast in multigrain yeah no not it i understand you are charging for the ambience but maybe just maybe try making food that makes sense pretty looking food good food pizza was nat up to mark it was tatseless and there is a prepaid system which is not generally not present in fine dinning taste is not worth the price love this restaurant my food was tasty and the ambiance was very nice highly recommend this place is all about the ambiance and is insta worthy but sadly when it comes to food and desserts its a very average sort of place portion sizes are tiny compared to the pricebrpad thai veg was super spicy with 4 thin slices of capsicum and that was all the veggies they could add in a veg dish black pepper fish was ok the rice served with it could have fit a small green chutney bowlitna bhi kyu diya sir the strawberry cheesecake was alright but the tiramisu lacked any coffee flavourwas heavy on pallet and was lack luster the croissant was so dry that one could use it as loofah this was my second visit and i am not coming back here for food certainly the service was so bad and they couldn’t even provide us with proper cutlery and kept asking if our table was to be cleared every 5 mins bralso we ordered a pizza which came burnt from one side hence had to send it back but it never got replaced and came like thispictures attached didn’t have the energy to fight more so left brdon’t think will visit again visited this place for breakfast particularly drawn by their highly touted fruit bowls our experience however left much to be desired the smoothie bowl arrived in a small soup bowl and came with a hefty price tag of rs 350brbri dont mind paying for quality but i do take issue when quantity falls far short of expectations all in the name of fanciness and health in other metro cities you can enjoy a similarly priced smoothie bowl but with a much heartier servingbrbreven the omelette didnt quite meet the mark for a better breakfast option at a more reasonable price id recommend checking out bbc at 10 number market unfortunately this is yet another cafe in bhopal thats falling short in terms of portion sizes not recommended for breakfast due to the high prices and small quantities my favourite place in bhopal the ambience is just too good for taking pictures food hotfresh brunique test are clean servingbri like cafe amado such a lovely place warm ambience and uncluttered seating the music volume was pretty low so you could actually have a comfortable conversation which is not usually the case these days in cafes and all the food and beverages were very tasty the service was reasonably quick and almost all the food came quite fastbrbrfor food we ordered loaded wedges verdure pizza veg lasagna and spinach and feta cheese cannelloni all of it delicious served hot and at a good portion sizebrbrfor beverages we ordered 3 spritzers lychee and kaffir lime guava chilli and pomegranate and raspberry again all of them delicious served chilledbrbrall this food and beverages for 2k is more than worth it 1210 would recommend if good food and ambience are what youre looking for it is a place id want to repeat for sure loved the food and ambience such a cute cafe with very warm vibes the cakes were fresh and the hot chocolate was perfect dont try cold coffee here its basically water and taste of food needs to improve however the place and ambience is awesome good outside sitting was quite comfortable but the restaurant was very suffocating the ac wasn’t working and it was quite crowded and unclean food wise it was fantastic the coffee was really good but seating could be better place is nice and the food was decent as well what i didnt like the managers attitude i had a zomato pro plus subscription with me and was going to pay bill through zomato only they told us not to pay through zomato and insted asked to pay in cash later when we were leaving he sneakily took back the receipt also and we were not able to file a complaint in the app this was so wrong of them a very nice place for coffee and sandwiches great service and staff the location is great they have a open air seating arrangement which is nice a wonderful place to hangout small cafe with quiet and cozy ambience they cater in munchies finger food coffee wraps smoothies burgers pizza fries deserts and freshly baked breads do try out their mousse its the best in the city sandwiches are lip smacking too for the nonvegetarian lovers you will love their meat choices worth the money i ordered a latte pepper chicken sandwich fries and a b52 mousse and it all came to just 550 inr awesome ambience coffee and blueberry cheese cake 100 pts for location will surely go again the place has beautiful location and ambience has both inside and outside dining options staff is also nice however the food is not at all good for food i would give 1 rating the waiter’s don’t look up to you they just don’t come to your table until you call them again and again nice and quiet place with 3 sittings like feel of cafe outdoor seating and nature close placebrmust visitbrfood and shakes were fresh and tastybrburger 455brpizza 455brnuttela shake 45 the bakery items here are must to try ordered a customised blueberry cake for birthday occasion and the cake was very delicious also the hospitality was very good they have good variety of chocolates cupcakes and cookies the team of caffe latte is polite and does a very good arrangement for birthday occasion br the amazing the food looks the worst is tastes i’m writing my review here as i highly doubt my feedback will reach the hotel management as they don’t have any feedback form but a register page which can be teared off from the register easily if you dont have seating arrangements then please dont take dining orders took us almost 30 min to find a proper seating and the ones who arrived after us were made seated before us i had hopes from this place as i heard about the hotel and the cafe a lot was never upto the standards we ordered 3 coffees and except for cappuccino the americano and the latte with vanilla flavour was the worst coffee i’ve ever had what to say about blueberry cheesecake the beautiful it looks the stale it tastes it was not fresh at all the only good thing was the puff but having so many options for puff as aloo mutter puff and veg puff came to know both are same then why take orders for two puffs aloo mutter and veg puff we left our coffees and our food half eaten due to this the last as in this corona time if someone requests for an extra masks the hotel won’t have it the hotel reception doesn’t even have masks as my mask was completely wet due to rain worst experience of noor us sabah ever as compared to the highend location the price is quite reasonable for almost every items on the menu we had tried a fried chicken burger two latte one with hazelnut a tiramisu and one chicken quiche everything tasted decent enough and the portion was also sufficient for one personbrthe ambience is peaceful and the waiters are wellbehavedbroverall a good and quiet place for a date or maybe a chitchat with your old pal over a cup of coffee booking was not showing to the restaurant its a nice cafe with good ambience and courteous staffthey have some good variety of burger pizza and finger food they probably serve the best pizza and burger in the town and they have variety of chocolate and cookie boxesyou can also go there for some good coffee and snacks they also have sheesha available which was quite nice my experience was very nice safe clean hygienic and great view parking space is good service food is fantastic late post alertbrbrif you want to spend a nice leisurely evening with your friends and family over good food and drinks this is the place to go located within the property of jehan numa palace this has outdoor as well as inside seating arrangement the ambience is really cool to hang out and have some leisurely time with some amazing food on the menubrbrwe ordered for four cheese pizza between two of us which had the perfect blend of cheese and a nice thin crust the quantity was just right for two people if accompanied with a side dish and had a burst of flavours with every bite they have a small patisserie as well which serves some nice desserts i never had a lemon tart earlier and was very sceptical to order but this one was really good and i really loved it they have lot of collections on desserts to choose frombrbroverall we had a very nice time with some good food and desserts and i highly recommend this 💕 while i have been visiting jehanuma for last 3 three years but that seems to be degrading which you don’t expect in 5 star hotel bri ordered italian hot chocolate what i get hot milk with some chocolate powder chunk of undissolved chocolate at bottom when we ordered for food while it has been stated in menu that its a all day breakfast which should be available till 11 but waiting staff was like you will only get shake tea and pastry brin times of digital menu if something is not available it should be specified in menu same menu from 23 years always very polite and professional staff great ambiance one of the only places in bhopal which has quality café mocha is a must try brfood options in the menu can get better i bought a box of homemade chocolates which i have done several times this time they were just a horrible mass of sugar with absolutely no chocolate content i had to throw the lot terrible i hope they get their act together now with taj and radisson in bhopal jn will have to work harder to retain their clientele cafe chino is the place to go of you want to eat authentic italian pizza hospitality and decoration add charm get away from the hustle and bustle of bhopal lane situated in the undying elegance of jehan numa palace for people who want to experience luxury with some form of a heritage property cafechino is the best location not that great as the case with the burger pizzas are fine it felt like drinking hot bournvita and the hot chocolate was worse and not at all appealing its a nice large seating area with respect to the ambience to make things feel more awesome i would like to go to dinner at night at night youll feel the cherry on top of you i found it overhyped it’s a palace turned hotel ambience is goodbut not great i went to their cafe ordered egg florentine it was one of the worst i have ever had in india it was not at all cooked properly only that it looked good blueberry cheesecake pastry was good and yummy also tried paneer manchurian croissant and spinach corn croissants both were just average food can be improved service was prompt lovely cafe with a closed space and a larger open space theres a mix of healthy salads with burgers rolls and the like the best dishes four season sandwich chino coffee this place was on my list from a long timewe had tomato and zucchini open face sandwich which was awesome and is a must have the potato wedges were good but their cheesecake was a bit dry as compared to other places the service was fast if u want to go to a place to have finger food in bhopal i would definitely recommend this cafe brtried there bakery items for the first timebrordered eggless pastry the pastry were not at all

paneer sw and pizza both were upto mark living upto its name found a rat under our table 🙃🙃🙃 the food is only okay but its one of the better places in bhopal only because of the ambience i also feel that on days when its not bustling with people the service is slower and poor we went there a few days back and found a rat under our table very disappointed and the staff was unprofessional towards it we visited this place and were almost seated for half an hour and no one bothered to take our orderbrvery bad service no one to give you the menu brbrno water served brbrthis really wasnt expected

drinkbrkindly share your upi id so i can send the billed amount back to you for this error coffee cup totally spilled delicious 🤤 very bad delivery experiencethey called me come to the main road then why i ordered on zomato if i go to the main road in front of shopand also the boy is very rude vwry bad experience delivery boy i had to walk so far in the sun very nice ambience amazing service worst pasta ive ever head bitter low quality bland absolutely loved it so fullfiling and healthy i was ltrly licking my fingers overall id say it was quite average there service was very good paneer salad should be renamed as bread salad quantity of paneer was too less as compared to bread visited this cafe today and was attended by employee named khushi very polite behaviour with great food and ambience half glass of coffee is empty worst quality pathetic taste excessive onions which made ir more worst waste of money guys there is no harm in adding 2 packs of sugar some people like their tea sweet amazing place to visit with you friends and chill everything i ordered was super yummy and freshand hothad a wonderful time maza a gaya very good food they people forgot to send the prepaid items x1 peri peri fries this restaurant is an scam please avoid ordering the taste is amazing vegetables is not fresh no patties make sure the free wifi is working before you order your snack brif you are here to work it is an amazing place with a stunning view and seating arrangement decent brewegesbrgood staff the coffee tastes nice staff is sweet i would like to warn everyone to beware of miss one of the employees she is shrewd and just wants to extract maximum money from the customers she never told me about the offer available online on zomato she was very arrogant and disrespectful and when i booked a slot and tried to show her my mobile screen as i was booking for the first time she denied to even look at the screen but when i went back to her after 30 mins to avail my offer she said that she has to speak to her owner take her permission before allowing me to place order this was ridiculous when i asked her why she didnt spoke to her owner earlier and take clarifications to which she had no answer i further requested to let me speak to her owner or else give me her contact details she again denied the cafe is good food is good but miss is not a person who in my opinion should work here as she is far away from the norms of hospitality industry i have the video recording of the entire episode not happy with the cafe being called as work cafethe music sound is loud which makes it uncomfortable for a person coming to cafe to work food was averagei will not recommend it to someone who is precisely looking for work cafe this place makes it uncomfortablealso washroom hygiene was not maintained experienced a very good coffee and beautiful ambiance dont even send sppon and tissue paper not good at all awesome taste and cafe vibe with very friendly staff staff is friendly and ambience is good food tastes nice and is pocket friendly view from the window is also great great service great place to be at excellent staff super quick service cost efficient and the best part is the tastebrkeep it up they cheated by sending wrong iten it is taste less very disappointed taste package is not sealed and very less quantity overall dishes is ok in taste but we are indian so we must try our indian foods we know the indian taste we dont know the taste of sushi and other dishes overall dishes is ok in taste but sushi is not good in taste only try and order first time from this hotel dont order again and again very costly both the boxes were half good very less no cutlery no pickle no salad this is it lol im never ordering again there are so many better restaurants with twice the quantity for the same price this is a insult this place has some amazing vibes the natural environment will definitely make your visit more memorable we really enjoyed our visit the dish that i liked the most was hara bhara kebab you should definitely try this the ambience is very outdoorsy they have seating near pool outside and inside ac seating as well the food tastes good we tried cheese cigar rolls sev tamatar dhabe style daal garlic naan and missi roti and also tried their sizzling brownie the taste overall is good but the prices are a bit high overall a nice place to spend your evening worst place to celebrate anything theyll give you every reason possible to not to visit them ever again they absolutely wrecked my birthday party we informed them each and every thing well in advance still they were sooooooooo very slow they didnt even care they left a single small teenager boy to take care of 30 odd people gathering isnt that a joke despite of informing them about our menu and the quantity to be served along with the timings of the guests etc they werent prepared at all they started with serving starters and they brought just two plates for 30people are you kidding me yeahhh thats what they did then when slowly and gradually we were thinking that they might catch the pace but they didnt and we completely lost the patience we called the manager but he completely vanished and didnt show up staff is totally unprofessional and untrained this place is good for nothing neither quantity was good nor was the food and timings were awful they ruined my birthday completely absolutely hopeless people and place this place is a big no noooooo rohit nagar countryside meadows overpricedbad taste and about quantity 👎🏼 almost spoiled my brday not an experience to remember worst redbull which had mrp of 125 on pack is charged at 149 🤞 overall food taste is good had cheese cigar dahi k kabab in starters dhabe ki daal really taste as dhaba paneer quality was good and soft only raita and buttermilk were little more watery else taste was okay staff is courteous the food was very poor quality good in taste cooking instructions were not followed good tastenice packing zomato gold is not approved here app is showing but hotel doesn’t take from zomato payment and food is also not good as of price ordered iceam which costed around 100 recieved icecream which costs 10rs in local shop pathetic is the word ordered italian sizzler which was un cooked as you can see in the pictures it was served raw staff denied it and said this is how it is been served next comes the malai paneer tikka which had the taste of indian sweet chamcham only the ambience is good at this restaurant the main thing ie delightful cuisines are missingbrlooking

attached brasked for gravy manchurian got dry restaurant is having a good ambiance but service is very poor longer waits for food and waiter doesn’t listen to you you have to ask them twice to provide you what you have asked for food quality is good but quantity is very less little over priced as per the location far from the main city area they even forget to provide you glass of water we have to ask ourselves to provide us spoons to eat and glass to pour water my experience was very bad the cheesecake was delicious they don’t know how to deal with their customers usually i never write feedbacks brbut today m writing this bcz the owner don’t know how to talk to his customers and we are their regular customer brwaise bhi aapka cafe chalta to hai nhi and jo thode bht customers galti

flavour did not recieved the garlic bread as in discription it was saying served with garlic bread thankyou for taking care of the onion and garlic note delicious as always ✨ their triple chocolate pastry is amazing extravaganza veg pizza also is chicken fried rice could be improved a lot the rice is under cooked and the shredded chicken in it have the same scenario very delicious food and cooperative staff garlic bread was completely burnt wow i got no burger the food was pathetic they are not clear for billing method they didnt allowed us to pay from zomato a great ambience 👍👍👍brtasty food 🤤brit has both setting dine in and rooftop affordable food prices 💕bra perfect place to celebrate your special day ☺️ worst experience everbrthe food was uncooked and none of the ordered food was tastybrbrnachos was ok in taste as there no cooked food in itbrbrstaff forced us to take the replacement for the uncooked food without our consentbrbrsheesha was not good the pipes were not washed properly the food was not good as per the price and the service was very slow and not at all good the place was kind of gloomy even though we were on the rooftop seating very disappointed taste is not upto the mark low option for vegetariansbrbrab nhi aauga kabhi yha the ambience was excellent the one thing that dissapointed me was the quantity of food rather than that everything was topnotch stale tasting sour really nice ambience and tasty food good for a date or hangout place the crowd was good and music was also not too loud staff was very helpful and well behaved taste is really bad with no pesto at all chilli chicken was way too much spicy as if it was ordered from street market brmurg makhani portion for 549 is criminal too less portion and very high price they are not taj needs to be clean and hygienic i am new to bhopal and used to delhi standards of dining went in expecting continental food since its called a bistro ordered grilled fish and the plate had more rice than fishbrbrthe turkish eggs were delicious full marks over salty fish and pathetic mac and cheese service is slow plusthey were screening ipl which everyone was watching but then they changed to soccer on demand of couple of people thereby giving them preferential treatment pathetic taste brvery thin texture and bad taste food quality needs to be fixed generally i don’t post this type of review but eat a ₹430 garden fresh pizza that is just blend and even the crust was burnt ecko disappointed us once againbrwent there for new nutella kunafa it was also flavour less bri think they definitely need to hire a new chef and even increase the portion size of items served coffe is spilled service is super slow it took them more than 1 hour to bring our order pathetic service took more than 15 hrs to serve us main course taste was average just an overrated place all items on menu feel overpriced we opted only because we had a decent zomato gold offer would never think of visiting again sorry to say so delayed order by half an hour in creamy alfredo pasta the creamgravy part was too runny it could have been thicker with better condiments in it the garlic bread size and meal portion was satisfactorybrbras for biscoff cheesecake it got destroyed during delivery but tasted fine it had lotus biscuit atop so that was good presentationwise the most wahiyat restaurant i have ever come across in my life time if you really want to waste your time and money come to this place is ache acha garibo ko khana khila do daan kardo they cook horrible food and they are so rude as if you are consuming it for free such arrogancy will lead to closure of their restaurant soon worst food ever noodle were half boiled it was much improved from when i had last ordered it the staff seems to have taken my cooking instructions seriously portion size is good too but the packaging could be a bit better i am truly delighted after my visit to ecko brthe mexican wings were awesome and i’d recommend it for everyone to try overall the food in entirety is completely fresh and hot and i didn’t have to wait too much either all the savoury dishes that i ordered like the fresco chicken or the baked alfredo just had such great texture and the chicken was extremely juicy there’s an aftertaste there that you just want to hold on tobrkeep up the service guys👍 wrong item delivered i ordered tiramisu its a eatable item when my item delivered i got cold coffee overall good but i had not asked for mushrooms as i dont eat them you added them in my dish anyway great place for work from cafe the hot chocolate was yum but it could be little thicker it was little watery than how it should be in consistencybrand ağlio e olio was extremely tasty with customisation option but the portion size could be more for 400 price indian food test food is not good brnot properly cooked and grilled food they served sour food service was not good good food hospitality by anil and others was amazing as well few food items are not up to the mark really less quantity and bad taste dined here on a saturday evening and there are mixed feelings on one hand the ambience is cozy the sheer number of plants lends it a cottagecore vibe but on the other hand the food leaves something to desire brbrwe ordered a starter a pasta and 2 drinks br1 smashed garlic broccoli 25 we expected broccoli florets steamed smashed and cooked in garlic butter but found a bed of sweet why creamy base consistency and texture of hummus topped with whole garlic pods and smashed broccoli our tastebuds were very confused and not in a good waybr2 creamy mushroom and spinach spaghetti 35 the portion was pretty small but there was a decent amount of flavour could do with reducing some salt though but it brought back memories of opening your tiffin box in school and finding cold maggi cake br3 citrus orange cold brew 25 i usually love this combination but you expect a cold brew to be cold this was more like they mixed room temperature boxed orange juice and cold brew and then added 12 ice cubes in it which ruined the enjoyment of my cold brewbr4 citrus lemon iced tea 25 it was more water than iced tea and i kept looking for the citrus flavour but didnt find much brbroverall go for the ambience but our experience of food wasnt positive getting 30 through zomato gold did lessen the disappointment in their food but would not repeat recommend no salt in the food they surely dont know how to make drinks cold coffee mojitos or anything staff was not in the mood for waiting table they were busy wandering around though when they saw us by any chance they attended us quickly price too high for the taste and service that they are providing ambience is good and car parking is an issue here might not recommend or go there again quantity was very less great food and great ambience every single item we ordered was delicious 😋 enjoyed every bite we ordered chicken tikka paneer butter masala butter roti lachcha parantha and chocolate brownie worth recommending… good food … excellent presentation… and chef is maintaining authenticity in the menu the food was amazing in taste and the service was impeccablebrthough i would recommend improving the quantity of food the place was awesome the ambience and food a perfect place to throw a party or gettogetheri m quite impressed by the foodjust keep in mind that although food was great but they take more thn avg time to serve so place your order thn enjoy with yr group n friends overall a must goto place would definitely be going again itemsmashed garlic and broccoli can be improved the hummus was not as appetizingtastes very averageit is served cold so not good for winters 15itemalfredo pasta and bruschetta good served hot 455itemcappachino 55 i have dined at ecko and ate chicken biryani which was delicious thinking of the place and food standards i ordered it today and you have given me blunt biryanibrbrabsolutely disappointed brbryou should consider that when we order food at home there are family members who taste it and eating such a tasteless biryani after eagerly waiting for it was so frustratingbrbrif you cant provide quality in your food dont send it 🙏🏻🙏🏻 very nice and delicious food we absolutely loved this place i went with my parents and my mom is already planning her next visit 😅 it’s the ambience that would wanna make you revisitbrbrwe tried alfredo penne pasta cheese cigar rolls iced latte affogato iced latte and fresh lemon mint water everything was really delicious i am a big fan of coffee so i personally felt the coffee could improve a bit staff were polite worst experience ever the staff was notably rude impacting the overall ambiance of the establishment the crispy corn i ordered was disappointingly oily and just fried corn without coating brpls do not visit it during quiet hours and due to the zomato gold offer its too oily and too spicy did not even follow instructions the food they served was fully burntas well the quantity does nit match the price they chargebr to top it off does not provide drinking water portion sizes are very small for the price and the same hasn’t been indicated in the menu in any manner slow service its the worst cafe ive ever visited the food quality and taste both are not good at all please dont visit here and waste your money the price of the food is too much and the quality and taste is too bad i dont even want to give it a starbr very mediocre taste told them to make it spicy but it wasnt to my expectation not value for money nice taste but the restaurant should have sent onion and chutney along the dish the starters were goodbrthe non veg platter can definitely use some more flavor and juiciness ecko artisanal bistro is a culinary masterpiece where flavors dance on your palate like a symphony the dishes are crafted with artistic precision and the service is a delightful performance its a place where food becomes an immersive experience highly recommended for fellow connoisseurs of creativity my friend ordered lotus biscoff cheesecake from here and it was stale and nowhere close to the cheesecake food was too good well priced cheesy keema nachos were amazing loved the place and will recommend others as well too good the chicken was smelly i asked the waiter to return it he said sure let me take this back but he came back after fifteen minutes claiming that he tasted it and it was ok so they cannot return it i’m obsessedddddd… it’s never enough the ambience is great and it’s a very aesthetic place however the food can be improved upon the blueberry milkshake and the garlic bread were subpar the service was good a nice place for evening snacksdinnerbrbrbrfollow whatkavyaate on insta for more such reviews totally worth it even though i’ve changed the whole meaning of aglio e olio by customising it so much but they put it all together so gracefully 🤌🏻 please add customisation in other pastas too food was good we had shakshuka which was delicious however the drinks were below average specially the mocktails spicy and poor quality aglio olio is very dry and it didn’t seem fresh cheese wasn’t mixed properly food taste could be improved a lot the drinks were made with artificial flavours instead of fresh ingredients which was very strong in the flavour of the drinks excellent taste they do not remember the food order at all brought the main course items first and the starters in the end one of the starter items they forgot and the other was basically french fries with sauce and sesame seeds which for some reason took them 45 min to bring taste of starters were bad main course items were fine please improve food quality it isn’t the best like i had lasagna it could have been a lot better pizza was fine the pasta is undercooked very bad wont order in future was expecting something out of a place this hyped food didn’t taste good service was too late i have given the order at 2 15 pm around we all are waiting but still the order has not been given till 3 15 in between i asked three to four times they just said sir 5 to 10 mins we fadup and left the cafe without taking the lunch not sure why there are so much of negative reviews for this restuarant i’ve been in this restuarant 3 times for dine in and multiple times for delivery every time i have got all items fresh tasty and above expectations keep going guys and all the best very good place for quality food and quality time 😄 ham restaurant gaye h aur food was also good but today i ordered n don’t know y food was very bad n taste also fabulous food it was an amazing experience and the food was so so so much delicious highly recommended mozzarella mushroom tandoor and blueberry cheesecake best cafe in the town one of the most popular restaurants in the neighbourhood ecko definitely does stand up to the hype brthe menu has a plethora of options for both nonvegetarian and vegetarian diners bri tried their cappuccino grilled fish in lemon butter sauce turkish eggs and finally the most talked about lotus biscoff cheesecake brthe fish and the cheesecake were unimaginably good i would definitely recommend them unexpectedly the turkish eggs was great as well i had a lovely experience at this new restaurant in the city the service is very slow and the taste has gone down from before we returned the dishes many times but it still tasted bad the staff was polite and good though service was slow and food was below average we were not given a table despite making a reservation on zomato it was actually a blessing because it was really hot there theres no ac and its on the top floor also theres no parking space you just have to park on the road nothing except rice was sent even that was average at bestwas hoping for a sumptuous meal disappointed but ok the thali ordered earlier was good taste not good oil was flowing triple schezwan was too spicy 🥵🥵🥵 totally inedible nuclear spicy but who in their right brains makes manchurian as spicy as triple schezwan sent the wrong item and it is not good chicken curry was terrible butter chicken was not cooked properly you charge a wholesome for this trash i have ordered a few times from here and the food quality has gone from normal to worse thuuu they didn’t even provided the mint sauce with kababs the order was for 4k but doesn’t provide value for money its so disappointing service was very slow we kept asking the waiter to serve even food taste was normal not that great that for the price that you pay only poor service soup pilled from package specially mention in biryani dont make it spicy and biryani is tooo spicynot even eatableits disappointing experience had the lunch buffet at effotel with my family today the buffet was supposed to start at 1230 but it began at 115 everyone was waiting at their tables and the staff was unbothered when the public asked about the delay brservice was very poor even after they started the service starters were served after main course the welcome drink tank wasnt refilled half the items mentioned in the menu were not served till 2 pm food wasnt hot it was uncooked and lacked taste brnobody came to clear the tables they were continuously short of dishes and other cutlery to manage the crowd they had broverall a very bad experience thank u very much dal was very tasty 😊😊 poori is made up of flour it should be cooked in wheat but bhaaji taste is good i have ordered around 700rs butter chicken got 5 pieces of undercooked chicken gravy is also not cooked and smell and taste like undercooked i dont know how these people can do this kind of practices wow quantity is very less no cutlery no salt nor taste i went there for a family dinner too many varieties of food the taste of food was delicious satisfactory and very fulfilling the staff was very attentive and well behaved i literally liked the way they treat their guest they will make you feel important it was a great experience we had sunday brunch the varieties are good enough and taste wise was also good the service and ambience was excellent overall the experience was very good no cutlery food package open excellent service by shri vinay and shri mohan food was also very tasty third class taste was not good and was not like biryani pieces of mutton was horrible very slow servicebralso food quality not at par with the pricesbr brownie is really bad hard to eat extreme oily briyani not worthy singer ki jarurat nahi hai singer ki voice bahut loud thi apas mae koi baat nahi ker pae kuch sunai nahi de raha tha humare anusar singer ko nahi rakhna chahiye you must be work on taste great deal one of the best buffet restaurants in bhopal expectations for gravy were high as it is expensive but it was below average there was around 10 tablespoon of oil spilling from the container need some sauce with it desserts not of standards sour curd was used to make lassi idli uttapam it tasted really bad nice food with good ambience everything excellent just onion salad not provided chicken 65 very spicy unable to eat incorrect food delivery that too uncooked can’t eat lots of broken bones too much kwada water has been mixed you take both the packets returned not worth 275 very bad experience entire food was floating and filled with oil third grade food quality for such high price food so bad even our pet dog didn’t eat it platter items were cold as an when they arrived and avg in tastebr biryani was blandbr super less amount of chutney and raitabrabsolute waste of money i have only want green chutney brfrom the last two times it was not there biryani khrab ho chukithi rice utar gye the pure all wasted all the 3 roti were completely burnt and taste of pulao was average its pity that you being a prestigious hotelit was totally sub standard rotis were already given to begger as such could not submit photo never before have i experienced delays in service at any sayaji property we couldn’t sample veg starters at all 3 stars are because of staff politeness and willingness to rectify issues but i feel the hotel is seriously understaffed pathetic followed delivery instructions sambhar quantity was less and was thickvalue for money was not there veg kebab platter was spoilt and fermented kadhai paneer was average in taste food quality are very bad my worst experience quantity of fry noodles is less and curd also less with biryani while ordering from sayaji we expect best quality i ordered this for one of my business client biryani is completely undercooked chicken is smelling like raw chicken with blood overall chicken biryani from streets are better than this very disappointing before writing this review i have apologised my client for 10 minutes thanks for destroying my deal sayaji extremely spicy food who puts chill in khichdi below average taste and overpriced worst butter chicken and tawa phulka i had ever very small portion size considering the price of item order that too mixed vegetable dish cold coffee was spilledbrfood not tasty poor taste there were some tiny particles like tiny stones didnt liked it i am very grateful that rastaurant has accepted my request and provided me mashroom broccoli and zucchini additionally butter chicken was excellent mutton biryani was also good but it was spicy though i had written for very less spicy quantity could be more more vegetables then noodlesno extra spicy sauce providedand i didnt find anything like burnt garlic flavour service is very slow staff casually ignores your request cooking instructions were accepted but not followed no platescutlery was included crackling in food bad taste nice taste effotel disappoints again the veg was good but every single kulcha and roti was overcooked to the extent of burningbrthis is my second negative feedback about effotel bhopal in the last 34 monthsbrthe reason i order from effotel is that i have been a customer of barbeque nation sayaji pune since 2007 or so and am sure that if the quality control will be as sloppy as this they are surely going to lose several good old customers and patrons it is certainly not worth ₹ 1400 plus for burnt rotiskulchas poor packaging delivery boy not putting zomatto uniform fish was not fresh dal was also very bad salt was too much and pineapple raita had a stale smell very bad food delivered this time kulcha was over heated the manchow soup is one of my favourites also ill say that the big chunks of vegetables especially onions dont really taste nice in the schezwan fried rice i hope the chef would look into this good preparations there are no bread cubes with tomato soup while in site it is displaying with bread very oily i had asked to keep it semi dry but it i gravy chilli chicken bad worst biryanino taste very oily food doesn’t taste good quality of food is also not good service is very slow requested for repeating starters and it took them 3040 mins to bring out food chicken smell so bad while eating poor taste not expected from sayaji very bad taste no proper recipe followed hello lot of salt 🤢 even after request for gravy manchurian you have supplied completely dry manchurianbrbrhorrible i ordered veg khichdi there is no veg in khichadi it a simple kichdi i got which is completely not acceptable please make sure what you have written in menu that should be delivered found very pathetic condition of food containing hair particles on food of 841 se the fried rice was of poor quality felt like it was not cooked properly and was not checked throughly either cottage cheese was like rubber hard something not likey expected from effotel sayaji group starter was good but main course and dessert is not so good we had a delightful experience at effotel sayaji the food was not only delicious but also presented with finesse reflecting the chefs expertise the ambiance created a perfect blend of comfort and sophistication making my dining experience memorable the staffs attentiveness and warm hospitality added an extra layer of charm a fantastic culinary and hospitality journey paneer tikkas taste is very bad food was nice very poor delivery partner food was not properafter giving instruction not to make spicy it was very spicyquality was not good fantastic food swift service excellent experience overall too oily and spicy with poor packagingbrbrbetter avoid ordering biryani was tasty but portion was small size price is very high when compared to portion450 for veg biryani is too costly i have ordered the same to check what is so

service never trust their offers these people make fake offers and then refuse by making any kind of excuse they also denied to accept payment through zomato or swiggy even your pre booked too hard to chewreally bad i really love the taste but gotta say avocado toast is overpriced the food was good cappuccino was average i was having zomato gold which was showing walk in instant discount of 10 but initially i was being told that you need to book 2 hrs in advance without which they dont accept any payment via zomato though later on upon my insistence i was allowed to pay via zomato this was a bit absurd and shouldnt happen not a cheesecake they cook delicious food the hummus falafel wrap was so balanced avocado feta cheese toast was super tasty yum recipes 😋 the food was tasteless and gaucamole was smelly no salt in pasta i ordered green salad with lettuce which is priced at 149 rupeeand all i get is mostly onion and a few pieces of careotand cucumber very poor servicearrived 115

dining experiencebrthanks keep up the good work good service anamika very tasty 😋 food nice place the food is excellent and the service staff are friendly and courteous biryani was excellent and the other foods was tasty the ambiance and food quality were excellent and mr amit provided outstanding service i love the ambience of this placebrwould give 55 for the ambiencebrhonestly thats the primary reason i visit this place but there are loads of things that can be improved upon for instance the menu isn’t extremely exhaustive as is and even less so for vegetarians which is understandable but when one finally makes their mind up to order they’re told that the dish cannot be served its good for a casual dining experience with friends thoughbr this is not for the food or the service but your so called policies which are abysmal to say the least at times the restaurant opens up at 11 am but god forbid if somebody comes early they wont even let them inside the premises i repeatedly assured the gatekeeper that i will not be roaming in the restaurant but will only be waiting in the premises he blatantly refused the location at which the restaurant is isnt exactly crowded which is why i was apprehensive of waiting all by myself outside in a secluded locationbrafter all this when i asked the gatekeeper to at least let me talk to the person concerned he blatantly refused to do that too amazing 👏🏻👏🏻 nobody is dying to come to a restaurant before it opens up but in situations like these there was not even a bit of concern shown i wonder if someone is dying outside would yall still ask them oh please wait outside we cant let you in even on the premises oh wait dont answer that it is a rheotorical question 🙃there are far bigger and better places in metro cities too but none of the people there behave the way you guys did brbrim just going to say this outright best café in bhopal by a milebrbrambience ethereal is the word to describe this place the indoor section is lit very well with nothing too bright making you feel cosy in an instant it is brought alive by a wide array of plants that seem to engulf the place a much welcome break from your typical brick mortar interiors which literally figuratively freshen up the place the outside is serene and surrounded the by the farm fresh produce that the café uses in all its products organic fresh local are the keywordsbrbrservice the servers are prompt in attending to you and catering to your needs they are well mannered polite and have a good understanding of all the items on the menu very lively they do everything to make your experience that much more enjoyable adds just that little extra to your experience but the difference between something ordinary and extraordinary is that little extrabrbrfood delectable ive tried their black bun mutton burger vegetarian club sandwich margherita pizza mexican toast and the orange ginger juice and i am delighted to tell you for the life of me i cannot find fault with any of thembra special mention must be given to the black bun burger and the margherita pizza the burger is bang on what a good burger is supposed to be its messy its big the mutton patty is insanely juicy the bacon strips do wonders and they are topped with very cheesy aioli the pizza just oozes freshness the dough is that perfect balance between crunchy and chewy which is the first marker of a really good pizza if i had to be pedantic and nitpick id say this the margherita pizza was created for queen margherita to represent the three colours in the italian national flag so i think they should make their sauce little more red right now its like a deep orangebrbrfinal verdict jehan numa have hit the ball out of the park with this one dare i say they havent put a step wrong the price at which you are getting all this quality is something to note a meal for two may cost north of ₹800 which believe me is incredible value for moneybrbrcheers brbrps apologies for the slightly blurry couple of photos was quite inebriated on my first visit😅br taste is not bad but charging 110 taxes per water bottle for a 20rs bisleri bottle is not worth at all paying 520 taxes for a pizza is alright for a place like this but water and taxes is not good for such a nice place entire ambiance of the place is just awesome i had the green house bistro signature pizza and soup of the day they were mouthwatering i definitely recommend this place i think green house bistro is only place in bhopal offering gluten free food perfect sunday brunch with winter sun and delicious food love this place has all my heart brlovely food beautiful place and absolutely amazing place for meetings love visiting green house bistro it’s one of the few places in bhopal which has a cafévibe but also serves alcohol although they don’t offer hardliquor but they do have beer and wine on their menu which works just fine brthis bistro has a really serene and relaxing ambiance it’s got an indoor and outdoor section which are both equally green the food’s great too i really like their bbq chicken jalapeño and onion pizza even the quatro fromaggi is a great option to consider but if you’re not a blue cheese person or trying it for the first time still acquiring the taste for it i’d recommend to not let it sit and stale their black burger is however the ultimate showstopper brlooking forward to explore the rest of their menu the greenery of this place is beautiful to sit by and makes an awesome backdrop for photos too i would recommend peri peri fries bean burger and almost all of their pizzas ever seen a chef casually walk out to the garden to pluck something for a dish it’s very much possible at green house bistro which takes farm to fork concept very seriously one can see the food being grown right adjacent to the dining space the restaurant gives green house vibes with open glass and huge planters inside making it true to its name brbrwe tried a lot of dishes and everything was fantastic sugarcane juice watermelon feta cheese salad pizza burger chat platter oriental bowl and many more we were too full for dessert for may be next time visited this place last week loved the food and ambience great place to hangout with friends and family there signature dessert is amazing place is really nice best for dates wow this place is so pretty and the food is great the pizzas the soup everything best place to chill if youre in bhopalbrgotta say the smoothie yogurt was a little sour but everything else was just amazing loved it going to definitely visit here again for the desserts its definitely pocket friendly as wellbrbr some cafes are story tellers they give us vibesenergy to be happy to be with loved onesbrgreenhousebistro is one of thembrif you like to spend hours with your loved ones then bang one this is the place you should visit amazing place had a couple of short trips to bhopal and place made me go back to it again again love dare black burger and the potato rösti with the delicious mushroom sauce cheers absolutely loved it brthe place had an amazing ambiance and vibe about it with it’s beautiful kitchen garden and the food was even betterbrpizza was good but highlight of my lunch was the mac and cheese lamb burger amazing ambience right next to nature 😍brsurrounded by their own little farmbrjustifies its name the green house bistro 😍😍lots lots of green just amazing during rainy season 😍brhad ordered their belgian chocolate shake which was yummy and chocolicious👌brtheir margherita pizza was thin crust hand crafted with fresh basili guess grown there only and was tastybrbut the best was the wild mushroom pizza which was just amazing 😍😍😍 the coriander pesto was just amazing and super delicious 😍brfood 55brstaff 355brambience 55br its the jehnuma this is the very first and till date the only outlet in bhopal offering gluten free meal one doesnot need to know anything further other than that this place will not dissapoint youjehnuma is distinctivly sophisticated with its style and never leaves you disheartened in any aspect of hotel sector be it food ambience concept hospitality and yes they charge you for it but at the end you are happy with it dats the only thing dat matters its perfect place for moonsoon weather to sit and have chit chat over healthy snacks with your frinds family or partner the food and service here is incomparable they have the best ambience for a cafe in bhopal their cheesecake is must to try absolutely loved the place the moment i entered here on a sunday noon the vibe winter sun view music menu basically everything brbrloved the gourmet burgers we ordered the black bean mushroom the soya chap one both were delicious brbrapart from that ordered the roasted pumpkin salad potato leek soup mushroom pizza farm pakodas akuri pavlova lemongrass herbal tea brbri found a small hair in pizza so i left it told the waiter but not even a basic apology much less anything else so not expected this at jehanuma out of all they took forever to deliver the order i can understand the sunday rush etc but the slow service was an appetite killer for that matter we had to ask for basic things like cutlery water clean the table etc very very disappointing so the two stars are gone here brbrthe pakodas were so crispy nice but as i mentioned the strange service they gave the dessert tea before pakodas at last brbrinspite of such a perfect place polite staff service wasn’t up to the mark at all beautiful ambience and great food probably my favourite place to eat in the city the mushroom pizza is almost worth dying for and the soups were beyond amazing must visit had visited this place in decjan and was planning for next one and got stuck with lockdownhahai must sayafter a long time am not able to find any negative point about a visit of minebrbrplus location staffs courtsey treatment given to the customerfood veriety freshness in it the flavoursrespond time for the given order ambiance and and more ☺️ green house bistro is a peaceful place a bit away from city ambience here is pretty good brwell margherita pizza is not too good brc8 signature dessert is awesome it is served with warm fudge sauce which makes it a whole lot better brstaff is somewhat irresponsivebroverall nice place having experienced horrible service at jehanuma retreat about 5 years ago it took a lot of convincing for me to go and give them another chanceand to be honest it was a pleasant surprisethe pizza and the burger were really well made and tasted excellentso after a month i thought of having a quick lunch at the bistro againand what a mistake it turned out to beright from the clueless waiters to the bistro manager who had no clue of which table was occupied reserved to the waitress who had absolutely no command of english or hindi language and had no clue about the menu menu if i can call it a menu that isalmost nothing was available no veg optionsonly one kind of pizzano variations available in burgers😖 the mezze platter which we ordered was a jokehorrible to taste with just one pita bread with 4 small tequila shots glasses filled with a small tea spoon of hummus and 3 other startershorrible to taste and look atthen came the burgersthe waitress was specially told to add certain ingredients which she nodded to while taking the orderbut to my surprise when the order cameeverything explained to her in simple english and hindi was missingthe burger tasted bland and had got nothing which was there when i had visited previouslyguys enough of brand name jehanumai will better off at having my fav buffet next door at sayajifor burgers i will happily zomato burger king 🙏☺️pull up your socks green house bistropoor show againbr best burgers in town so juicy and fresh my favourite is black bean mushroom burger brtremendous effort on the part of management to provide bhopal with a vegan organic and a unique menu love the decor and ambience staff is amiable and helpful will definitely visit again soonbrconsistency is jehan numa’s hallmark and i hope green house bistro their new kid on the block doesn’t disappoint moving forward what not to love about this place truly amazing and the most fav in town i love their pizzas and latte also do try peri peri fried here its so flavourful the menu is not versatile even if you are ready to pay a good amount the dishes arent that quality shakes and other drinks are quite disappointing but what is love is the surrounding the atmosphere and the chill vibe visit it for an experience a terrible place to visit or hang out the staff is not at all friendly we were given wrong information at the reception that it’s open till 930 but when we reached there at 9 they said it’s closed bri wouldn’t recommend this place to anyone avoid going here overall experience was great the taco was one of the best i had the healersmoothie is also very tasty the ambience is right for the date u see mainly student crowd talking about the drinks the average cost of beer is 350 taxes bira corona this has been a very special hangout for me ever since it started i especially like the way they make shakshuka their pizza is great and their sandwiches are very good pesarattu and multi grain dosas are great vegetarian options my only grouse is that they give you 6 puris in a chaat platter its a bit ridiculous given that you spend about 400 bucks for it was looking around for a restaurant that would serve homely food this placed not just did that but also treats you like one of their guests the shop looked like it was about to close when i asked the owner hes like it never shuts awesome only 1 boiled egg worth rs 20 in 130 rs curry that means 110 for gravy pathetic worst packing ever whole oil gravy was licking on carrybag egg nahi h sirf gravy the quantity and taste are not worth it for 650rs other restaurants provide much better value the taste is different when you order and the

terrible experience at hod i planned my boyfriend’s birthday here after seeing an influencer’s post but it turned out to be a huge disappointment the staff were unprofessional with only two people managing the whole place we had to ask 34 times for everythingbrwhen most guests left the staff turned off the lights and music while our group was still eating even after asking them several times to turn it back on one staff member said light aur gana chalane ka alag se paisa lagega we couldn’t believe itbrthey charged a high service fee but there was no service – we had to even serve ourselves also the menu prices online on swiggyzomato were fake the real prices at the restaurant were much higher to make it worse the staff kept staring at us while we took pictures making us girls feel uncomfortablebrbrdont trust influencer posts – they’re paid to give good reviews read real reviews like this one i wish i had before visiting burnt food food should be cooked atleast the marination is not even absorbed properly in the paneer i ordered chilly pannerbrpieces of paneer are too burntbrand gravy so spicybrextremely soya sauce in gravybrworst experience no chatting and salad is provided

packing food quality was not good beakr taste 👅 not good at all waste of money dont buy 🤮🤢 very nice soup 🥣 somehow the quantity given this time was less as compared to when ordered before brthis time it was in a medium sized jarcontainer rather than a large or big sized container hence it was drastically less in quantity to much spicy low countity dey sent burned parathas got boneless butter chicken with only small 2 pieces in it the order which i received was empty box received a plain maggie without any vegetables awesome fooood butter chicken was so delicious and the quantity was more than enough loved it 😊 if i could then i would rate in negative stars the biryani was burnt and sabzi was undercooked food was rotten i thrown it into dustbin and decided to call again to this restaurant delayed delivery got it terrible experience – zero stars for service and staff behaviorbrbrwe had a lunch reservation for more than 10 people today but when we arrived nothing was prepared to make matters worse the air conditioning wasn’t working properly making it extremely uncomfortablebrbrthe most shocking part was when we found a hair in one of the dishes a friend saw it and threw it out but when we informed the staff they outright refused to take responsibility saying we should have kept the hair as proof this kind of attitude towards customers is completely unacceptablebrbron top of that we asked to have the service charge removed but they insisted it had to be paid if the payment was made online this behavior along with the poor service is just patheticbrbri strongly recommend avoiding this place zero stars for the service staff behavior and broken ac the taste wasnt good at all gulab jamun was spoiled garlic nan was hard saddi hui maggie likha kuch aur pani m ubaal k de di waah worst chilli chicken ever such big pieces that too hard do not order from this restaurant guys pasta taste is very bad sause or cheese is completely broken worst pasta i could have ever seen extremely pathetic they didnt allow us to pay through zomato gold and also didnt removed the service tax on asking the staff was not at all cooperative and good also the food tasted very bad and the service was very very slow will not recommend it to anyone mutton was not good at all even the gravy was not of mutton rogan josh abhi to kha liya h baki photo kal add karenge🤣😜 delivery n cooking instructions has not been followed by the restaurant unsatisfactory services excellent asked for cutlery not a single fork or spoon given not value for money just there to loot money not responsibily delivers food well well well lets start with the chef googling how food is made sheek kebabs is a fairly easy thing to make u see youtube can be a good starting point i am just taking the privilege to highlight as it seems no one has till now and this restaurant is still supplying food of this pathetic quality i am sure the guys at the restaurant feel its great and i think it is for the drivers as well who stop by for dinner with that said the cost should be like that na but the display and the propaganda is where the money is spent rather that quality anyways khana bekar hai thora sahi karaiye ordered kebab and honestly it was so bad that i am writing this cheers n all the best but take too much time to cook food very badbrthe pasta was stale and the sauce was probably not freshbrvery disappointed it was about disgusting in taste and the only taste i can feel in this dish was of salt and nothing else literally guys wasnt expecting such low service from a brand like you this dish was tasting anywhere near to chicken tikka masala it was just salt and salt that i could taste i want my full refund the taste of veg biryani wasnt great the khade masaley were not good in taste too much ilaichi love it they charged extra service charge including gst charges extra not fair they are going to take service charge but they will provide food after 1 hrs of waiting the taste and quality of the food was not good this restaurant denied payment via zomato gold and told if you want to pay via zomato gold then you cant get service charge removed poor quality of biryani and too much of zydal all u can taste is pudhina and zyphalbrvery bad biryani poor packing all of the dish leaked the food was undercooked brand the chocolate dow was raw there was no cheese in cheese

karo thoda mulayam aur ho sakta haibrbrbaki sab theek hai👌👍 taj is a name hospitality and service is good but not food i would never consider to repeat my experience when it comes to food the condiments served were inaccurate as per order and when i pay good that means you should think of using actual coconut cream but not the syrup or essence in mocktails or cocktails any good dinein use fresh cream then why is taj charging too much but serving lesser to avearage people go there for a vibe i get it but food and drinks should be topnotch take it as a positive review or negative but yes i expected taj without flaws food is priority i entered taj for attending sunburn event but there is no crowd in that event so i thing went to infinity and enjoy after spoilling a mood but im confused and no one guide me how to i reach infinity lift is not going on top please mark signages or helpdesk great view and a perfect location for a sundowner small bites that encourage tasting of different items and a truly creative bar team br the recently launched menu at infinity is extensive has quite a nice variety loved the thai curry margherita pizza spring rolls hummus falafel wrap sliders french fries mini tacos liit whiskey sour cosmopolitan all the drinks that we tried were crafted to perfection appreciate how they are working on adding new dishes and improvising on the feedbacks we visited taj on 1st january the ambience was so sad that i have to ask that is it really first of january why is it so sad the service was pathetic there was only one service guy and he was not even looking at the table we have to wait for him for like eternity to come and serve the food i thought maybe the presentation would be good presentation was pathetic then i thought maybe taste would be good taste was much more pathetic the entire experience was bad they are making ppl fool and charging huge amounts just because of the name people are coming there expecting good service good taste and good food but everything was just pathetic so think twice before coming here they are difficult at times but they also try to provide resolution for any issues faced not too satisfied but still manageable it was an horrible experience at taj receptionthe entry gate has got a broom placed on the counteri met mr saranshhe was very calm and he did try to resolve but the executive chef was so pathetic and rudei would never recommend anyone to be there recently visited infinity by taj must visit place in bhopal if you want to experience luxury and one of the best location in bhopal for sunset 🌆 it was a very good experience we went with our parents to have dinner and the food was quite amazing the service was also top notch staff was very polite and cooperative we loved dal machan the most i had a very bad experience with them their staff was ridiculously rude and denied my booking claiming its first come first servebralthough i called them 3 hours back to confirm the same and made a booking either their front reception staff was clueless or these were clueless i will never recommend them to anyonebrmy personal experience with them was absolutely horrendous embarassing to an extent taj lake bhopal is not recommendable at all first of all parking problem their vallat parking are dead slow n they dont have self parking where as other hotel s have 2nd food taste is pathetic also this place doesnt pull good crowd everything is great the service and menu has improved lately they just need to improve their music it’s very dated and can be made a lot better to suit the unmatched location that this bar offers according to the price omg the food was so pathetic in fact not at all good and especially the quantity according to the price was so lessbr we ordered some cocktail mentioned in bar menu that it contains absinthe then after we asked staff that about ithe knew nothing about that then he called bartender he said it is our own handmade formula of absinthe not the real absinthe another scam was that chola taco nothing but 4 puris filled with chola worth 20₹ raj was good server great ambience best party place in bhopal with your friends and family food was horrible and extremely tasteless and very overpriced rest ambiance is good good taste and staff was good but visit in evening or night times for better experiance the food is so tempting scrumptious and i love the ambience great ambience and service must check out 🥂 food was below averageneeds a lot improvement amazing service by raj good food and drinks the ambience the food the staff everything was good i really enjoyed my time here the staff was extremely supportive and the food was delicious too ac was not at all workingbrstaff was not at all professional food was okay staff wanted me to pay offline food was delicious and good service by mr raj frauds running the cafe they may position themselves as premium but are just following cheap roadsideeatery level tactics to first attract customers with zomato gold and swiggy dineout offers but then denying the offer at the time of payment by bluntly lying that they will not get payments from zomato and swiggy due to some false made up issue and force you to pay full amount stupid tactics for such a premium place doesn’t matter if the food is good if you cheat customers for petty money you’re just another stupid cafe which will shut down sooner or later because customers will catch your fraud tactics i gone there 2nd time but i was very disappointed when i saw my bill i ordered there 4 cocktails and one veg snacks when i saw my bill i got astonished that they charged for four cocktails and rs 1875 etc for condiments like tonic water etc which is a part of drink this is my mistake was that i called bar manager and told some specific choice about my drink it was very disappointing i am residing in bhopal from last 30 years and gone almost all famous restaurants lounges 5 star hotels etc of bhopal rest part of india but this type of tendency i had never seen be cautious you all next time when you order some specific drink in ivvory bhopsl bansal one service was great food was tasty ambience was

satyendra thakur🫶🏻 fabulous service from mr dhiraj kumar not very impressed with their bhopal branch whether it is the quantity or service or hospitality chef is quitefine but the issues is with the portion vs cost ivoryy is not a less known name i have visited ivoryy south delhi quite a few times and with that image i have visited to their bhopal branch but had a bland experience may be they still needs time to understand that this is bhopal not south delhi very pretty ambience great food and amazing staff especially mr soni 👍🏼👌🏼 awesome place with super tasty food and ambience good food test and presentation both are great though its a bit costly but its worth it liked the atmosphere here you can spend some great quality timeall the staffs are very polite and on the toeif you want to customize any dish as per your test they would do it as well today i booked table for 2 through zomato reason being very impressive menu card shown here on zomato which has 10 leaflet after reaching the restaurant i was given a two page menu card with very limited articles on enquiry i was told that for saturday and sunday they only serve limited menu but i can choose from white variety of drinks available i said i dont want to drink but food is the reason why i opted for your restaurant then initially better told that you please let us know what you want to eat we will prepare when i said that took place order at least i need to see the menu he suggested i can check it online again i reach to the zomato page of the restaurant i opted for risotto immediately i got answer that we will prepare risotto of for you but you have to pay more than the listed price on menu posted here on zomato which sounds crazy to me but since i was hungry i thought okay no point arguing but i was finding it difficult to read the menu on my phone i requested at least you provide me hard copy of the menu i will choose the item and if you wish you a charge little higher after sometime the better return and told that no the menu cards are in the locker and they cannot take that out as there was hardly any item on the menu i had to leave the restaurant hungry i raise the complain and at least zomato people were concerned and kindly love and they return by booking charges of rs 50 👌🙏🏽❤️🤣 the place was amazing good vibes not seen any place in bhopalbrthe food and service was great the manager named mr rohit is so rude pathetic and hopeless he doesn’t know how to talk to customers and he is such a big liar i request mr qureshi to change him because he is ruining the image of ivoryy he is saying to us that we are a liar this obese pathetic shitty manager should be penalised service was not good managers argued once we said plz remove the service charge they said that zomato discount won’t be available if service charge is removed wonderful ambiance with amazing food and cocktailsbrbest in the town very good food and amazing hospitality very well service by mr kushal i used to enjoy last night all are okey but price has lit but high acc to service which i taken some of the drinks are not available so i rate as 3 star raj was very pleasant and nice need a dislike button here in zomato overall good but air condition was not working and even after complaint no use br mix review food and ambiance is quiet good order was served quickly the restaurant forces to pay service charges good service by mr raj brhighly recommended for dinner here excessive service charge they charge and they denied payment from zomato negativebr adding service fee brno proper bag for parcel step into ivory where asian flavors dance on your taste buds and the service is a symphony of excellence the ambience wraps you in a warm embrace while the menu takes you on a culinary adventure its a foodies paradise where every bite is a masterpiece prepare to be dazzledbrbradditionallybrat ivory the service is like a graceful dance with attentive staff members who anticipate your every need they sprinkle hospitality like confetti making you feel important from the moment you step in its a place where smiles are contagious and genuine care is the secret ingredient prepare to be pampered food is overpriced and serving quantity is very small they do not provide finger bowl niether they have wet tissues pricing for product is more than metros but missing on quality and portion size we had pre booked a table via zomato and paid the cover charge the staff was pushy towards service charges and when we told them its not mandatory to pay service chargesthey told us we will have to pay full charge if we pay via zomato thust trying to deprive us from zomato benefitsbrthe staff cannot force the customers to pay any other tax apart from cstgst first of all they add service charge after repeatedly asking them to remove they dont budge i explained them that it is not mandatory to have service charge and can be removed on consumers discretion they were rude and after so much heated argument they removed it but then they werent ready to take payment through zomato as it already service charge removed so we got the discount extremely pathetic reasoning and behaviour from their end i booked the table through zomato by paying a cover charge they want the business from zomato but arent ready to comply with zomato guidelines i would suggest not to visit there if you want a good time from price point also extremely expensive if you want to splurge this much please visit jehan numa or sayaji much better service and no kitkit the hotel management did not give us a table even after zomato booking they mentioned that offline bookings were made basis payment and hence zomato bookings are not validbrdo not visit they forced us to pay a service charge very bad staff unethical dealing with customerson zomato gold they fisplay 20 discount on table booked billsbrbut tgen add unethicall and unlawfull service charge in billbrwhen confronted they say if you pay thriugh zomato they will put service charge if o e pay directly they will remove service chargebrin a way they are recovering discount amount of zomato through sevice chargebrbrwont recommend any one to fall in their trapbrbrand more worse they made some backend hacking wherein even the promised discount of zomato also didnt appliedbrpathetic mr ajay served us really well food was excellent the starters are delicious but the main course was average these people don’t know anything about service and how to handle people they are just taking up bookings and not delivering on time at all it’s a shitty

cocktails and mocktails m surely visiting again today as well to taste other typesbrkudos to amer team ingredients are missing very less quantity too dont receive cutlery it is written that they will give 6 pieces but it was not there also not enough gravy quantity was very less as compared to amount taken never ordering from here give ear o ye heavens and i will speak calling all butter chicken aficionados have you paid a visit do so if nottravel to bhopal if you must but do so barring ones that know their onions butter chicken in delhi ncr has been relegated to a tart and overly acidic tasting chicken tandoori doused in underdone tomato gravy here thou shalt mirthfully discover what truly butter chicken meant to be its a magical recipe that took the winds out of the wings of them british subjugators them rulers celebrated as the epitome of the genius spawned off a human mind under duress this recipe is easily the most ordered dish that i have seen in my humble outings with friends and family this place is almost an ethical reminder to all wavering and untrue exponents of this sacred recipe in delhincr and a torchbearer of pure taste and culinary expertise help yourself to a generous serving paired with a good wine and celebrate being born a human cheers chicken pieces were too small gravy is still best in town but i think they should consider giving substantial size pieces gave 2 stars just for the gravy soup was tasteless brstaff is ill mannered complimentary rotis and salad were missing also the packaging was not appropriate seemed like somebody opened the package good such an unprofessional attitude of the people working there after calling so many times they confirmed the ordersuch people simply drown the name and fame of the restaurant pathetic best place to dine love their service great performance by the staff courteousprompt servicegood food cocktails lovely ambience prawn lovers do every combination they offer for prawns totally worth it the relish and grilled chicken were too salty veggie lacked any taste and were undercooked the grilled chicken didn’t taste good either and no garlic bread was sent very disappointed excellent awesome chicken biryani raw manchurian food is too good but is too expensive through zomato gave instruction to give grvy paner chilly unfollowed the service is poor and the food is also not that good we tried vegetarian we have to wait 45 minutes after ordering for the main course apart from food and ambience their staff and service is very polite and humble ive become a regular at jharokha because of their great service and delicious food well done guys ✌🏼🌟 itme is miss in it biryani salan is missing dal tadka at fine dine is more delicious food was not tasty breads was cold food quality is not up to the mark breads were not available service was slow and butter paneer masala was below average great service and receive hot food on time the staff almost forced us to order their butter chicken saying it is their specialty but didn’t specify anything about the quantity small 2 pieces in half plate brmutton biryani apparently comes with 4 pieces of mutton but we had to search hard to find

of the once famous and renowned amer palace what was once an institution of excellence in terms of service and quality lies in shambles pathetic and forgetful service quality and average quality of food make me want to cry as a child this place was my favourite and our go to place for dinners and special occasions after the experience i have today i am never coming back excellent ambience and lipsmacking delicious food good place to hand out with friends and also with family the place is huge and always packed food portions are really tasty although the costing is bit on higher side but you wont regret it as they offer great taste and service at your tables very spicy paneer tikka it was not three way only red paneer tikka with too much spices no taste and irresponsible service pathetic restaurant here i tried the worst malai chaap of my life i believe every owner should try what he is serving to the customer chaap basically comes from northern india i had it a lot in delhi and punjab region but the chaap this place is not even 110th of what i tried in northern india awesome thai curry absolutely horrendous there were spillage issues to the point where other dishes were drenched in the hakka noodles sizzler the pizza was very undercooked in some places while overcooked in other places the broccoli was tasteless with no salt or anything the only good thing were the hakka noodles and the sizzler but the sizzler was all spilled mushroom chilli basil didnt had basil tasteit was average taste kebabs were delicious but the pasta was very spicy making it difficult to eat awesome place to have dinner by the pool side best place to have good time with family and friendbrbrhad a great time really loved the variety and service was top notch the only thing left me

bhopaltest is too good special day ko or v special bana diya sayaji restaurantthanks to sayaji restaurant😍 best barbeque buffet restaurant in bhopal and thats not just because of the brand name but the variety of the menu which changes daily ambiance to dine in next to the pool with live barbeque on your table with mouth watering veg n non veg starters the live music 😍🍸🍻 even they have happy hours daily😄 this place is one of my favourites thats only because of the ambience of this place as it is a poolside buffet restaurant as soon as you arrive at this place you are gonna get the roasty smell of the barbeque which raises your senses and immediately the thing that strikes your mind is tandoori fish or chicken or grilled paneerbrsince this is a buffet the menu is fixed and the staff serves you the plates which are defferent for veg and non veg staff is quick and you are gonna get your belly filled up by the starters only now if you are still left with a bit of space get to the main course food lineup lots and lots of varities which are mouth watery also at the end dont even dare to miss the desserts brfinal words must visit place for ppl who crave for non veg foodbrcheerz one of the best in the city you fall in love with the ambiance start humming the music played relish eating every bite of food being served all at the same time plus its wide open with a pool in front of you and it makes you feel like youre attending an occasion each time you go there worth every buck you spend treat for your soul brbrtry mixed sauce pasta highly recommended ❤️brpani puri on the buffet area is delicious and has both the hygiene of a five star and taste of a local dishbreverything served to you in the starters will satisfy you enough ask for jain starters too huge fan of them very neat n clean restaurant polite n profesnl staff hygeine maintain n proper social distance follwed by them gr8 experience must visit n order from swastik if u want best pure veg foodbrall d best swastik u make my day thanks a lot againbrmust try spl vip thali paneer dishes of swastik i have been to barbecue nation in delhi and dubai i have heard somewhere that all of them belong to the sayaji group and so does kebabsville that was the reason i always wanted to try this one out now there was some kashmiri food festival going on when i visited kebabsville i was always fascinated by the concept of barbecue on table however perticularly talking about this outlet its more of a gimmick there wasnt really many options in veg for grilling most of the starters were served directly on the plate i am not saying it was bad but was like any other decent restaurantbrwhen i visited the place was pretty crowded hence the service was a bit slow main course and sweet dish were great worth trying starters were considerable i am comparing it to the barbecue nation in delhi and in terms of servicetaste and value for money barbecue nation easily outperforms this one as that one is cheaper and you get more variety and prompt service despite the crowdbr best barbeque ever you can have one can go and find peace with nice food served right in front of you hot fresh and yum chicken and mutton lover find a paradise here must visit in bhopal it has easily become the one place wed love to visit again the diy bbq buffet is a treat by jtself when it is followed up with a large spread with several main course and dessert options you really need to take time and eat the buffet starts with 6 varieties of veg n 6 varities of non veg in a diy style on thr table while the veggies arent exactly left with an option the non veggies will surely not be disappointed at all there are live chat counters and a really good bar the buffet has about 2 soups 8 main dishes along with nanrice and noodles the desserts are also quite tasty but can definitely be improved a meal for two will come to 2000 rs excluding drinks awesome place to unwind and catch up with friends and family there is music too on weekends 7 of us in family dined on 2nd aug18 to celeberate birthday ambience were nice staff were pleasent most of food were good everything seems nice untill next day 4 of members fall sick with food poisoning with one with critical treatment kitchen seems to be managed badly stay away from it we dont expect any action from food quality department but we will surely report its shame that such kitchen are allowed to operate like this its a perfect place for any group of people be it couples friend group or family gathering ambience is just on point with dinner tables being around the pool and with musical nightsbrfood is just awesome from starters to main course to dessert they have a variety to offer both in veg and nonveg its a must visit for everyone i loved it sayaji hotel is a brand itself last sunday i visited kebabsville best place to have a buffet at reasonable price ambience is very nice and you will be enjoying buffet with a poolside view your dishes will be grilled on the inbulit barbecue placed on the table i opt for non veg buffet in which they they also provide some veg starters if you insist now about the taste of the dishes the dishes which i love are as follows in starters i would suggest to go for roasted pineapple roasted prawns chicken tikka and for roasted chicken leg in meals two dishes were served that were hariyali chicken korma and dhaba mutton well i was more interested in dum mutton briyani it was one of its kinda taste i will recommend it the most in sweet dish i will recommend you rajbhog with rabadi and choclate brownie theres a lot of stuff to eat here if u are not in the vegetarian fandomvariety at its fuckin bestbut sadlysome of the stuffs is not that great7 to 8 starters in the buffet but tastewiseonly 2 to 3 are greatsame with the main coursethe desserts are good though yummy food 455brdelicious dishesbrdifferent experience with diningbrtasty beveragesbrdessert was fine enoughbrawesome service 45brbeautiful ambience 45 the meat was a tad bit overcooked but all the faults in the food which were anyway minor can be overlooked as the poolside barbeque thing is one of a kind in bhopal the poolside is beautiful i have heard a lot about this place from my bhopali friends but id have to say i didnt like this place much maybe because i am a delhiite or maybe because i expect some nicer food standards whatever the case maybe i think people of bhopal seriously lack in their culinary arts coming straight to food i found the buffet horrendous snacks were absolutely ridiculous tandoori items every single one of them felt like i was chewing rubber all of them tasted alike the main course menu was also highly disappointing they had only one edible dish butter chicken desserts were tasteless i couldnt fathom why the crowd was pouncing on buffet ambience i would say the open restaurant is a good concept but only at those places where you dont get wasps and flies landing on your food converting the swimming pool area to restaurant made the whole area look more like a shaadi hall instead of giving it the posh look theyd been hoping for rain also acted as a dampener 2 stars because the buffet was cheap at rs 600 for veg buffet its alright i have been told to go on a better day again but will i i think not main course and dessert is fine but i feel like the starters were stale and the service is horrible w it offers sumptuous barbecued chicken or any other choice on mini grill on the table to start with followedup dinner paradise for foodiesbrbrto avoid disappoint it is good to call and book a table in advance since it is usually full it has a good ambience with a large central pool and seating around d pool live classic music playing in background they have a well spread buffet the food is good with a variety in d buffet staff is courteous good place to visit if u r a couple office group or a family group we went for birthday celebration and experience was awesome food was very delicious ambience was best best place for eating nonveg buffet one of the finest buffet dinner in bhopal is at the sayaji bhopal dinner experience much like barbeque nation the

quick n warmbrbrhad a nice family time wow went with my close ones for buffet dinner spread on sunday which had 5 main course dishes 6 starters for veg and wide varieties of mouthwatering desserts and many moretaste was midblowing service is where sayaji group stands out they personally have arranged the cake at 1130 pm when restaurent was about to close the moment they got to know it was my bday even when i insisted not to we had to wait for 30 minutes for table due to which they kept saying sorry throughout the serving hats off to the management these guys are really proficient in their field one of the best and only outdoor self grill barbeque restaurant in bhopaltheir oriental buffet is just great with great varieties and tasty foodexceptional service however its quite pricy but definetely worth a visitonce again food was very goodbr to start off the ambience is quite elegant and romantic if youre with your partner brstarters are in variety but falls flat when you start the main course broverall appetisers and desserts are worth it they need to work on the taste of the main courses brwould visit again sometime had vegetarian dinner in mid of may 17 ambience is one of the finest in bhopal with live music and pools side sitting brin food we particularly liked the starters kababs pineapple kabab was very good and we ordered extra servings for it the main course didnt meet upto the expectation created by starters but deserts made up for it brbron the serving front we felt a bit left out as the servers were more busy serving table with louder people seated adjacent to us and we had to call them politely and remind many times for extra servings required by us this is my first review ever one word for food quottastelessquot extremely bad presentation received burnt snacks super spicy food and very bad menu of buffet there is also no proper cooling on every table due to bad fans positioning i suggest you all to save your time and money for some other restaurant dont be fooled by its ratings like i did this doesnt even deserve 1 star very disappointed with the services doesn’t pay attention to the customers if u r looking for spending that much money u should opt out for some place where u can get the service better this is really good with a peaceful ambience food is tasty 😋 buffet menu is not that wide as compared to indore sayaji but its a complete family hangout the staff and service was not upto the mark had to wait for each and everything even for a glass of water after reading great reviews i went for dinner today what a let down for a sayaji restaurantbrbrfood 20 bad brambience 25 with a function happening nearby in banquet there was so much noise that the live band of kebabsville could not be heard awfulbrservice 35 it was

barbeque for a foodie the two words unlimited and barbeque are always a delight to hear and when combined its always a treatbrunlike delhimumbai etc bhopal has very less unlimited barbeque live grill concept restaurants among few is kebabsville of sayaji my review includes non vegbrfirst the price its ₹1050 for non veg a bit on higher side when compared to bbq nation and all however the quality makes up for itbrthe ambience is good there is a pool which makes for a beautiful scenery and especially if you are thinking of a date brthe starters include chicken tangri chicken tikka fish tikka mutton kebabs and even chilli chicken you can get if you ask chef chicken was soft and moist and tasty for veg starts you have mushroom paneer tikka and since i went during food festival time fried banana chips and quesadillas which was okay in short the starters were very goodbrmain course is good and chicken curries are nice the bread is soft and tasty as wellbrnow comes the dessert and i believe this is the only area where kebabsville is average the desserts are limited in option and among all only few are tasting good some of desserts k tasted like fruit custard blueberry cake cheesecake etc were not good chocolate mouse was tasty in context of desserts kebabsville need alot of improvement otherwise it would have easily gotten a 5brbut still its an amazing experience and the tasty food justifies the 1000 rupeesbrthe staff is amazing and very courteous they fullfill your requests as much possible and like bbq nation they dont accept tipsbroh and there is live singing as well which is lovely my friend had birthday and the siger and staff sang song for him along with cake things like these make live bbq even betterbrreally recommend you all to go and enjoy the food brbr a perfect dine out place perfect for non vegetarians the buffet was too good the delicacies from different places from the globe starters are too good the best nonveg buffet in

if you are fuli assure youll fall for the dessertsa large variety of them and each one is slightly better than the otherbrownies are 1010need to improve since sometimes they dont serve hot best of bhopal value for money nice location with great ambiance swimming pool adds more beauty to this place food is great in bhopal must visit the best place in bhopal the food is superb i highly recommend this restaurant there was live music and very pleasing sayaji and its services are always appreciating staff food greeting style etc everything is way to more than excellent and the concept of barbeque grill bliss by poolside indulge in everything exotic at kebabsville food is lovely in taste and you will literally feel relaxed when you will take dinner near pool or just make your moments memorable i will definitely suggest this place especially for special occasion celebrations this is a post regarding poor quality buffet at kebabsville sayaji bhopal bri with some friends from lucknow went for dinner yesterday even after spending a whopping 95k we were so disappointed that we have blacklisted this buffet in our list brthe veg section feels like a waste of 840 bucks they serve same old paneer and mushroom on the grill like they have been doing every single night there has never been any variation while my non veg lover friends enjoy different tikkas and starters every time either the chefs are too incapable of making something else or the management doesnt want to in either case the customer wastes their money brbrwe ordered cocktails which were again a terrible experience the cocktails were watered down so much that you could barely taste any alcohol screwdriver was just plain orange juice lit had everything else but alcohol and old fashioned was just sweet water brbrthe main course was again disappointing for thr vegetarians of course lack of chefs thinking power comes into action here all they can make is a paneer dish and a mix veg while again my non veg lover friends enjoy countless varieties of dishes brbri hope this bitter review reaches the management and the chefs so that we can atleast be satisfied of the costly buffets we order in the coming times for me ill stay away from this place for a year or two until i hear good reviews againbrbrps theyve paid the local food bloggers and foodie groups so that they dont publish bad experiences my post in bhopals famous foodie group was not published saying sir they provide us with event favours like discounts the only thing that kind of forces me to rate low ie the price point the prices can still be justified if they are inclusive of all taxes the early bird rates should be charged inclusive of tax the food here is really tempting and delicious it has a wide range of options for barbeque as well as the main course and dessert the barbeque and desserts are the best part though the lovely pool side view is the cherry on the cake being one the best all you can eat buffet at the offered price kebabsville is hands down the best place to go if you have that buffet itch the variety is plenty and the non vegetarian advantage is evident while i hope for more diversity in the desserts section the starters kick it out of park the ambience is upscale and is worth a dressed night out go before 8 pm the prices are lower great treat to your tummybrpool side dinner with retro musicbrgrilled starters followed by a huge variety in main course and mouth watering desserts staff is very friendly and quick as well plus they provide a complimentary cake if u are celebrating birthday must visit place a dinner buffet at sayaji doesnt go wrong nothing like indore but bhopal didnt disappoint me eitherbrbrcoming from being loaded with people and a wait time of 15 minutes ofcourse worth it we started to hog but this one is gonna be a veg buffet review guysbrbrstarters on table barbecue with sticks of pepper garlic pineapple paneer tikka n mushrooms on plate

after hogging much is a definite yayyyy no no to nayyyyy brbra buffet priced at 944 for veg incl taxes is definitely worth it happy eating the best kababs buffet in the townyupp you are hearing it rightlovely ambience and especially the dance from the lovely dancers they had a lot of different cuisines to try out dessert is just finger licking they have got the best quality starters in bhopal coupled with a perfect ambience and very well behaved and helping staff food quality is very good a complete value for money buffet best place to chill out with friends and family especially pecially the aura is cheerful and staff was very reliable the service is really awesome i tried the buffet in which they served the authentic mughali cuisine brbrwonderful experience for visit 🤩 i cant expect anything that goodgoing to bbq since 8 years it would sound like i m exaggerating the things but from my experience😊😊its indias best buffet in terms of varietywill visit again bhopal has very few options when it comes to buffet and of those few options the one worth visiting is this place the very first thing you observe while entering is the ambiance such a lovely setting beside a pool the receptionist will guide you to your table based on the number of people and while entering one can observe the beautiful lighting and live music playing in one corner the service is very good you will have your own waiter serving you specially and making sure that you are satisfied with the food there are numerous starters starting from grilled prawns kebabs chicken legs fish etc i opted the non veg buffet the main course ranges from variety of soups salads indian and chinese cuisines you finally end your meal with desserts having all kinds of pastriesmoussescustards ice creams brownies etc etc so you can see this place is a best combo of good food good ambiancebrbralso almost every month there are food carnivals and festivals going on where you are lucky enough to enjoy special cuisines so you can call beforehand and enquire about it the price is good enough for a buffet in such an ambiance yes you cant afford it quite often but trying sometime will be worthy enoughbrbrambiance 45brbrfood45brbrservice45brbrlastly have sufficient time in hand when you visit you need to enjoy all the food right situated near van vihar and beside lake the location is nice pool side tables add a great touch to ambience starters are nice but options are very limited especially for vegetarians main course is average at best spices are imbalanced in many of the dishes breads were the only take away desserts are decent rasgulla was awful though they served cold gulab jamun which in my opinion is best served warm staff was friendly but numbers were limited had to wait for very long to get attention of staff there was live music which was good in quality but they took long breaks between performances overall it wasnt worth it at all not as good as indores kebabsville and that is why i find it a bit expensive too taste can be better ambience is beautiful and service is good too the best in the city when it comes to barbeque the seating area is very luxurious with pool beside your table the music is very pleasant and i requested 23 songs and they delivered it whole heartedly the nonveg starters are very good and makes your daysbrthe taste of main course is just above average except the biryanibrso overall it is a great place to dine with your family and friends brbr amazing hospitality yummy food nice polite and helpful staff this time sayaji bhopal didnt disappointed us though indore one did it lastly last time we opted for a la cartè this time we went for a buffet dinner yesterday it was a closed ones birthday dinner out and we opted for nonveg buffet dinner all the chicken starters were so yummy even the fish starter this time was good enough plus the mutton galawati kebabs were a real time authentic because its hard to find this softness of it in bhopal city though we didnt had the prawns the starters were themself hunger satisfying with yummy taste approx total 6 variety of startersbrbrcoming to the main course the chicken dum biryani was lipsmacking even jehanuma hadnt served ever this much tasty biryani till now just a personal review the chicken and mutton gravy dish were also very yummy although i didnt liked the fish gravy the breads were so soft to make a morsel with gravy we had butter naan and garlic naanbrbrthe desserts were also good and with so many options served we just got confused what and what not to eat cuz we were too filled up n not a big fan of sweets these too were approx 6 or 7 which were more then enoughbrbrthumbs up cuz they pre arranged the table decor cake when came to know about the respective persons birthday we tried to give them tip but they politely said no to us again n again for it as tips are not allowed over there this thing too is different from other hotels here lovely it was thanks a lot im surely n definitely will gonna visit again n again now for the buffets rather then having it elsewhere best buffet experience in bhopal everything is great chinese snacks are excellent ambience and service is good live music if youre into it best non veg buffet experience in the city best fine dine in bhopal with family and friends they are providing best buffet in the town non veg and veg people can find paradise here awsum experience of having the dinner they serve you good food having awsum taste i will recommend the prawns esp in kebabville as it will satisfy the taste buds and one more thing it is not that expensive so u can go for it without thinking best place to have buffet dinner on poolside restaurant kebabsville with on table personal barbecue🍴😋👌😀brfirst of all the location of hotel is very nice i love this place very luxurious and beautiful hotel in town it is out of town so atmosphere is very peaceful and pure serving awesome tasty food with skilled service staffbrsayaji hotel is

location 5fast servicebrbuffet costs 👉1 899for veg 2 999for non veg its been a long time since i posted a review mostly due to my traveling it gives me great pleasure to review this fantastic place brbri was meeting my family after a long time and decided to take them out to a fine dine place i settled on kebabsville mostly because of the pool side seating which looked stunning in the pictures it didnt disappoint the ambiance was very well done from the arrangement of tables around pools to the ghazals that were being live performed brbrthe buffet offered a lot of variety ranging from diy barbecue starters to myriad of sweet dishes the veg kebabs were very delightful grilled fish was another delicious offering its hard to list all the dishes that left me wanting for more but some great ones were keema kaleji and grilled prawn the main course had a lot of vegetarian and nonvegetarian options but nothing stood out it seemed average especially in comparison to the starters moving to sweet dishes the fresh made jalebis with rabdi was my favorite and filled my soul with syrupy sweetness overall the food was a good but i hope it would be even better the next time aroundbrbrthe service was flawless i have no comment on it except to commend the entire staff for their warmth and professionalism in creating a memorable experience for usbrbrthis is an experience i would definitely recommend to everyone ambience the restaurant is near poolside and has seating for couple friends as well as large groupsbrbrfood is good they serve 6 veg starters and 6 non veg starters so you are spoiled for choice chicken prawns mushrooms seekh kebab pineapple were served and all tasted nicebrbrservice was efficient and staff was courteous in fact the staff went out of the way to prepare a chicken dish that we wantedbrbras this restaurant is part of the sayaji group that runs the successful barbeque nation franchise it was expected that food will be great i would however rate barbeque nation a notch higher the unique thing about this place was live singing which some people surely would enjoybrbrconsidering that it is bhopal i found the pricing at approx 1000 to be on the higher side an evening well spent here as always the food was delicious some starters were cold but quickly got them replaced a bit heavy on the pocket but the taste of the food is too good an amazing and lively place where you can enjoy your food sitting right next to the pool while you can listen some live music too for someone in bhopal who loves barbecue this is the absolute pit stop a wide variety of food veg non veg both to relish upon along with a drink or two just the perfect place to be especially if its a big group of friends or a corporate gathering however make reservations beforehand as it can get quite crowded especially during the weekends i wasnt very sure about the whole idea of barbeque buffet but this place changed my mind snacks are as good as the food and deserts we went there on a saturday so booked a table to be sure and got a confirmation message right away the goan food festival was on had 2 3 different dishes with their normal menubrsnacks are amazing especially would highly recommend the corn tangdi kebab and prawnsbrhad a lil bit of biryani for dinner which was goodbrbrambience 55brstaff 55 tips their arent allowed and they politely

friendly staffmust try items include crispy corn and baked vegetablesthe desserts are great and the soup choices are different each day pathetic services offered by shri naveen and shri ramnath their treatment and behaviour was not acceptable their main focus was on serving less number of food items on our table limited food items were made available on our table in a strategic way to avoid our requests brbri was a big fan of sayaji hospitality for the last 1520 years but this time it was painful i wish sayaji read my review and improve their hygienic standardsbr the menu does not change at

would rate it 55br total value for moneybrnice selection of dishes both veg and nonvegbrnice ambiencebrtheir starters and desserts are gr8 brbuffet around pool is a nice concept and sayajis hospitality is well knownbrfood is tasteybrone has to come and feel this experience the craze for barbeque nation has just been crumbled all thanks to this place choices the variety snd the distinguished types for every nonveg dish was too good it puts to rest any kind of hunger though its is at the outer side of the bhopal city but still stands up in its reputation the choice of menu is good specially the tandoor is best desserts are unique and awesome sincei am a non veg consumer i personally liked it wonderful ambience with heartwarming service the food as multicuisine tastes very good this place serves only buffet veg and non veg the menu spread is wide variety of starters but few to choose from non veg main course mutton in dum biryani was lil undercookedovercooked as it was chewy 67 extremely delicious desserts were served out of which lychee rolled rosugulla was eccentric and relishing the attendants were benevolent and agile firstly kudos to sayaji for bringing the diy bbq buffet concept to bhopal i had eaten such buffets at barbeque nations and absolute barbeques in bangalore and goa but when i went here with my family all of them were so happy to see a new concept of sorts of having dinner brbrmoving on the ambiance is great if you are looking for a lovely poolside quiet dinner this can easily your pick brbrthere is a llloooooooooottt of variety on the table starters desserts main course by the end of it surely you will lose count of how many things and what all you have eaten especially for nonvegetarians the place is an absolute treat brbrcoming to the bad things well i can point out just two one is the cost which is slightly high not if you compare it to similar buffet places but definitely if you compare it to other places in bhopal secondly this is not a place where you can go again and again the menu becomes monotonous and i feel vegetarians are left with really limited options they dont have anything apart from paneer aloo and mushroom in any buffet anyways brbrso i would say that this place can be visited for a oneoff experience especially if you have not been to such a diy buffet place ever an ok ok experience the restaurant does not live up to expectations after sayaji indore barbecuenation gives a better experience in spite of a less elaborate menubrneed to improve upon service team of two handling br34 tables fails to handle the rushbr very good one of the worst buffet ever tried not worth it brquality is not good at all… the choices of food was very less even on sundaybr 1 the dinner buffet costs 899 tax on weekends gst

pricing is reasonable when you take into account that its a grand eat all you can buffet in one of the most premium restaurants in bhopal omg this place had always been my favourite place for dining the whole menu and servings is delectable their wide range of kebabs in nonveg and veg is flattering such amazing staff and poolside view with live music is very pleasant ambience service food hospitality everything is sooo good its the best place for buffet in bpl both veg and non veg their usp is pool side sitting with live music its one of the best place for spending good tym with friends family i have had very average experience with kebabsville there are very less options for vegetarians staff is not attentive the only good thing about this place is their pool side seating

unfortunately due to a jam packed day we got a farther table nevertheless we started with appetizers and all of them were fresh and tasty maincourse was average desserts were excellentbrbrservice is really commendable live music added a charm to the ambience had a great time with family not so great the ambience is so so amazing the pool side makes it so great i loved the buffet system of them

buffet at rs1000 is worth it brthe quality of food they serve and the service they provide is outstandingbrbryou must go and enjoy a lavish dinner at kebabsville awosome bbq bri need to really appreciate the hotel staff for managing such a good ambiance the chef was too good all the hotel magan meant staff really deserve appreciation must go place in bhopaldelicious food and amazing ambianceloved itworth the price did not have a wonderful experience as said by other reviewers the ambience was good but service was awful our table had 6 people 4non veg and 2 veg the nonveg starters were quick to flow but the veg starters were no where to be seen even after informing the waiters few times even the person incharge tried to argue that their service was great even though you repeatedly pointed out that two people on the table had no food on their plates the buffet had lot of choices but then we found a fly in the baked veg i must add that the place did not charge us for the 2 veg guests on the table in all not a great evening visited kebabsville for a lunch party and was very impressed with the experience as whole the way the restaurant is setup around the pool and its ambience is really beautiful brbrand the concept of live bbq is new to bhopal i guess so its very good compared to other restaurants which serve general buffet especially loved the desserts and starters do visit itll definitely give you a very good experience to go home with went for their buffet on sunday and wham the place was choc a block with diners few tables had bday celebrationone a meeting seminar the soft buzz of activity combined with music and some delectable snacks was a very good start to our eveningbrthier tandoori pineapplecrispy veg were just right in their preparation we had generous helpings of those cajun spiced potato was average sweet corn soup was v passablehad simple dal chawal from their buffet and some ice cream for dessertbrbrthe service was prompt and efficient considering the load came back with a happy full tummy this place used to be the best but has gone down now the food items have been lessened and the food is cold and sticky the service is very poor now the waiter bangs the plates on your table and whatever you ask for they are like bas itna hi hai they just want to get rid of you they wont get you finger bowl to wash hands they give you paper napkin what a joke and the rudeness you will want to punch them in the face even the suited booted managertypes standing on the entrance are in on it and when you try to give feedback they start looking elsewhere womens washroom is behind the bar can you imagine what moron designed this monstrosity i visited yesterday night with my parents wont visit this crappy place ever again fern and marriott have much better service and food our overdue visit to kebabsville finally happened the expectation was set by the buffet we had at jahanuma and in comparison the food was pale at kebabsvillebrit guarantees you quantity of food but the same cannot be said about the taste and quality the chicken was suspect in every dish and the prawns were bland the food was average and doesn’t justify the hype or price in addition the buffet doesn’t offer a welcome drink and we were treated to sad and emo music with bugs flying around our foodbron the bright side the staff are polite alert and very helpful they do their utmost to address all your table needs and even involve the chef if there’s a special requestbrwe probably won’t be having seconds here and i believe the issues lie behind the welcoming smiles of the staff one of the fine dine places in bhopal sister organisation of bbq starters and sweet dishes are good though variety offered is less compared to bbq they have great music and pool side area which makes it magical nd worth the cost service is a little slow they should add more options for veg barbecue paneer mushroom pineapple really is that all high time they should think to add more versatility to their barbecue menu rest all things were great in taste and buffet has sufficient variety and taste 260821 went last night to celebrate my bday which was my mistakebrgood view credit goes to property designerbrhost lady her name was mamta she was quite nicebrservice was good the person who attend us i forget his name but his attentiveness was awesomebrstaff was completely following covid protocolsbrnow finally the main worst point worst experience was its taste very much disappointed tasteless food feeling like we are eating raw marrination in raw meat like water so i am not going to prefer anymorebrit was not like before thanq so much for spoil our eveningbr had a very bad experience better not visit a big sprawling place loads of tables poolside live band sunday was bollywood and i assume its the same always great service an attentive staff i was staying at the sayaji so walked in for a beer the hotel could use the bar space more effectively they dont have bar stools and i had to unnecessarily occupy a table for just beer on a crowded night cant comment about the food scene in bhopal and coming from delhi i am always biased because its really tough to beat delhi when it comes to food didnt have food here but full marks for ambience and courtesy a buffet at kebabsville is the best one could have in bhopal with a satisfactory price range and with an ultimate variety in the menu papad muglai stuffed roll and veg stick with tomato mint sauce were yummy and something different to try to dal bhukara which is the ultimate speciality and cooked for like 24 hrs had an incredible taste i loved the huge variety of desserts each with a different flavor and texture peanut butter chocolate pie was okayish for me because peanuts arent my thing always but i love love loved the paan ice cream irani bhaklava malai shahi tukda sheer khorma and biscoff cheese cake for me the list of favourite dessert is endless herebrwould visit the place again one of the very few places in bhopal where prior table reservation is highly recommended brwhen we went to kebabsville they had punjabi as a theme for everything right from ambience to food brthe entire restaurant right from its entrance had punjabi flavour to it including decorations and punjabi dress code for servers we were escorted to our table by the pool youre first served starters which include few live grill dishes such as paneer pineapple and few others such as pani puri corn kebab and couple of more its highly recommended to have as little starters as possible to enjoy their buffet to the fullest then there were punjabi dance performances along with live music as fillers brin buffet the savoury dishes were slightly disappointing i particularly had sarso da saag and makhi di roti and i literally missed the original flavours therein then i hogged onto the desserts the highlights and showstoppers were some hara halwa and jalebi with phirni brthe total cost of the buffet including taxes with one redbull and one mocktail was around 2300rs which was fairly decent considering the overall great quality of experience and memorable night kebabsville offered i hv a wonderful experience here i luv the atmosphere pool side barbecue live music very good service verity of yummy food my table service man mr divan is very good managing my barbecue dinner thank you for the birthday cake and at last kebabsville is the place where i m come again this one is for hotel staff 😍😍😋😋👍👍 please dont go by the 4 ratings here its totally not worth it mr sachin is the biggest liar he misleads the customers bron the phone they refuse to take table reservations but when you walkin they tell we have to wait for 2 hours since we havent booked a table in advance management please stop buying paid reviews and act on this unethical and unprofessional attitude visited multiple times great food and great service the tables by poolside and live music brings a soothing element just one thing is that they need to bring some changes in their menu it has been the same from years my all time favourite their starters specially the prawns are awesome i went during the arabian food festival live belly dancing was enthralling food as usual was yummy you can eat to your fill since it is a buffet and also partake of unending i repeat unending starters desserts had baklava etc a great experience the one restaurant which was awaited in bhopal is here finally live counters live barbecue and a garland of dessert was was just like a cherry on cake it was truly a wonderful experience been here on a freezy evening the food here is similar to barbeque nation but what stands out is its pool side dining and live orchestrathe starters and desserts stands out in taste and quality main course is average the waiter mr virendra verma was very courteous the first restaurant in bhopal which i liked d most the starters and the main course was really good but some of the desserts were not that good had gone there with pursuit of they will be carrying same legacy as kebabsville indore but it’s pathetic even after charging 1000 taxes hardly there were 2 barbecue options and the quality was pathetic don’t know how it’s rated 49 please don’t go as sayaji bhopal is surely way par below standards while asking for a cocktail whiskey sour it was told that worse service ever people are the rudest and they dont take zomato booking technically challenged with 0 etiquettes brbrthey have no sense of how to run a restaurant and work with apps amazing 😻😻😻😻🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩 true to its name its so relaxing and the kebabs are the best the chocolate brownie with vanilla ice cream are amazing😍🤩😍🤩😍🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩😍😍😍😍😍😍😍br if you are feeling damn hungry then this is one of the best place to be at best buffets in bhopal without any doubt some may find a little expensive but trust me its worth it not just the food the service the ambience is just awesome roasted pineapples are my favourite starters and the bunch of desserts at this he last makes it just too wonderful ambience is great i really loved pool side done theame with soft music and the food is great i really loved all the stuff starter main course dessert all were perfect great food great ambience poolside sitting with shamiyanas service is up to the mark even on crowdeddays service and food quality remains topnotch one of my top three choices when i want to have a drink outside the lovely concept of grilling your own meat while sipping on a beverage is very enticing not to mention the fact that they keep serving additions that the professionals have grilled to mask the misadventures that some of us might have had always a good spread not much variation but does the job well best place for a buffet lunchdinner undoubtedlybrbrambience 45brvariety in options 45brtaste 55brquality determined by the condition of your stomach the following day 55brbr i think it’s pretty overrated the food is alright so is the service we had the buffet dinner and few of the stuff were great but overall not really worth the price there are much better places in bhopal that serve better food at much reasonable price a bit out of town location and non residents like me not so easy to navigate from the airport but all that was faded out of my mind as soon as i entered this placebrbrits basically a poolside restaurant with barbeque style food with an addon buffet considering we were there in the thick of winter the air was icy to say the least but eating those delish kebabs on fire was a treat neatly marinated perfect blend of spice and succulent taste yummy not to forget the amazing biryani from the buffet total nawabi feeling we also enjoyed the desserts in our very brief visitbrbrunfortunately we were running quite a tight schedule to put it mildly so well be remembered as people hogging this superb food in mad rush and then sprinting towards our waiting cabbrbrbut no worries this place will be on our mind as and when we be in bhopal the food should name this place kabadville pathetic starters and main course both brwont ever recommend to anyone kebabsville as we all know is the pilot for world famous barbeque nation restaurant chain across india they have been the pioneers in the live grill on the tablen concept totally love the concept but off late have visited the bhopal outlet during the festivals they do brbrtoday was an arabic food festival though the food quality was as good as always service was impeccable as always i feel that though they do food festivals food somehow remains the same other than fancy arabic names that 99 janta wont be able to pronounce or relate to the food was as indian as it could be same was the case with the kashmiri food festival last month brbrdesserts were good though with umali and baklava i feel over all they missed the plot by including regular chaat normal indian breads same old tangri and prawns in the starters brbron top of it the music playex during the belle dancing was deafening to a point where you could not even talk to your next seat neighbour if the dance was on so even though the dancer was pretty good we were wanting for it to stop rightaway and this is when we were at the farthest table possible brbrguys you do a good job throughtout the year but please you need to make sure that during the food festivals we need to eat something that you do not do on regular days best family restaurant for me to go with my family staff is so friendly and very alert at all the times good food good taste and good memories this restaurant is more preferred to go in winters because of grill on the table not worth the hype rating and price the food was not good the marination on the starter was too spicy ambience is okay not that great since it’s open air restaurant a lot of food items had moisture and didn’t retain the crunch desserts were horrible definitely not going another time i’m not sure about nonveg food but veg was worthless and tasteless as this restaurant is part of sayaji therefore it is very evident that ambience has to be elegant and sophisticatedbrthis place has barbeque themeyou will get everything for around rs 700 this will include scrumptious starters followed by full fledged food and desert this is buffet so one can have wide varieties to treat their taste buds in veg as well as non vegbrthey will also have live sufi music performancesbri must recommended this place to all the gourmets out there to go and try out the only authenticated barbeque in bhopal with the concept same of that of bbq nations this restaurant by sayaji hotels is also awesome making sure to not disappoint anyone with the flawless pool side live music and awesome ambience the deserts were too good we have been there in mid june it was drizzling rain which made the visit more awesome brbrambience is really good pool side sitting arrangements we got a table which was next to buffet section so it was little inconvenient brbrstarters were as always maintained to its barbecue nation level excellence specially chicken and mutton gravies were delicious 😋 brbrstaff and services were quick couldnt click much photos during this visit br vegetarians please avoid good service of crap brbakery items are stale snacks are below average brvegetation main course is quite unpalatablebr what caught my eye was the ticket price very reasonable the buffet has lots of choices and the dessert is pretty good the bartender is extremely polite and highly cooperative brthe grill and the starters are good but can improve more a good place to wind up your day the only thing i liked in bhopal is kebabsville best place for romantic date open pool view musicbrawesome place couple should visit ones a barbeque nation concept very nice ambience the main course needs some more addition and some variety in starters than the usual ones or else the charm diminishes in some months the food and service both were great the price was specially very much affordable and the taste is much better compared to other buffets i have been to a must place to visit in bhopal awesome ambience abundant varieties of cusine vegnon veg starter totally worthbrbri got happy hours discountbrno corporate discount 😐brlive chinese counter missing 😶brbrreat no other thought just enjoy the moment 😝😝 worst place ever khaya 100 rupe ka bhi nahi kha paya 5000 ka bill diya 1 rupe ka concession nahi kar paye ye 14 baar complaint karne ke baad bhi free ka cake dia jo inne wo baat dia mene garibo ko sayaji kebabsville apne naam ke aur image ke lie hi sahi you should contact me regarding this review revert karna agar sach mei apologies chahiye to number share kardunga baaki to waise aapke staff ko sab maalum hi hai paneer tikka aut thode bht snacks ke 5000 rupe pay kardiye hain 🙂🙂🙂 ambience was too good also the taste of food were also good just that they need to check on the quality of the food like the panipuri were not crispy the snacks are awesum although due to that you will surely miss out the buffet grilled snacks wid drinks n pool side table makes ur mood vn u dine wid ur frns although music concept is nothing new to bhopal hospitality is pretty well too oohh the punjab tadka festival was a hit didnt add cheese bruh worst meal ive had fries were stale burger was soggy roll was ok burger was good but was not warm enough i was supposed to get 4 different dips you gave only 1 different chicken and choco lava cake both were cold i ordered big 8 bucket and got 7 piece where the smoke grilled is 1 piece less and 1 piece is not even leg this means i only have 2 leg piece in that teast is not as expected peri peri not received in case of takeaway order they intentionally leave out some dishes so always ask for the bill and check for the contents before leaving the restaurant also always ask for bill in hand as i never receive the bill on my phone till date this avoidance to provide bill is literally a scam remember the name sanjay ahirwar did intentionally hide chicken popcorn i was willing to act but was with my infant and thus avoided any fight the kfc is a brand they should keep a check on such persons who try to defame the name of kfc i always choose a burger with cheese and pay extra but i never ever get the cheese in burger food was delivered cold stale bread leftover chicken no veggies and very different taste from usual wings and popcorn had no taste and spices tomato ketchup nhi rake the great all the left over they send the bread of the burger was totally stale and the chicken tasted very oily and old as well i didnt expect this from kfc this time never order from aashima centre always old undercooked chicken chicken was not good nothing was fulfilling chicken was too old restaurant was so irresponsible and unavailable they first have removed their cooking instruction and was unavailable for call am allergic to tomato and regrading that i called them to remove it they havent pick the call and now i cannot enjoy my mean as it contains tomatos so much disappointed by kfc hoshangabad branch no good food test ☺️ dont waste your money not good packing and mixed up of products hair found in hot and chrispy all the food is cold and uncooked disappointed ☹️ substandard kfc franchise dont expect the correct order from them cold opened choco lava cake what a joke better try other outlets in bhopal osssmmm i ordered burgers and got something else hot and crispy chicken order was mix with some other spicy chicken very bad service kfc is just this kind of packaging and all no spoon cold items dellivered very disappointed by the packaging and delivery 😡😡 too small in quantity the food was stale and i immediately got food poisoning after having it please for your health’s sake don’t order from them the food is totally cold it’s not freshly fried either the batter was not cooked and it had no salt it was a dissapointment to the guests kindly do not give matter like this after hefty amount taken pieces were almost cold in such a scorching summeri think they fed me a day old foodit was so coldplease do not order from this outletalso the taste kfc offers it was way beyond it full of oil cantatin pieces wrong dip sent to wrong address order given to us is wrong good test roll it is good sometimes but the patty was small and the burger didnt feel big enough at all kfc is missing the consistency nowadays good food they are missing to send ketchups and when they send they send just two with a full meal order not everyone keeps ketchup packets at home gravy should be separately packed why the burger is like this i have ordered for 1 large fries 2 burgers but only burgers was delivered these are no fries in it i am disappointed about the packaging the cold pepsi made the whole packet wet even the packet of chicken popcorn please make sure about the packaging next time thankyou loved the taste ❤️ french fries not available bad taste its too cold fries not fries it tastes like raw potato the food is very cold taste was not up to mark soft drink was not chill so experience was bad noice hc

veg rice bowl didnt served hot not even warm i got the worst kfc burger and chicken ever inside burger the veg is old and smell is not good fried chicken is buried veg longer was not there burger quality was not good i ordered peri peri boneless but it was bony its should be hot and fresh 👌👌👌 poora thanda bekar chicken tha chee found a bug on my fries i am so furious right now i was a constant customer of kfc at bhilai nothing like this ever happened is was the 3rd time i ordered for kfc bhopal and i found a bug on my fries infact i was about to eat it never gonna order from here now i hate kfc the food was smelling very bad it seems like the chicken was oldthe food was very bad in taste not able to eat brbrkindly revert me on callbr the food was so badly prepared everything tasted stale sauces quantity was less the order never got delivered the food was cold the chicken strips were way too small felt like one was cut into two some dry and not so fresh chicken wings 2 were there rest was fine items was missing and dont attend call from zomato to clear the things for compensation good फूड my order is wrong because the receipt is wrong placed on parcel now the kfc is not picking the calls too dry overcooked not at all juicy too much crust had to look out for chicken flesh because of heavily breaded outer crust didnt like it at all the other outlets are comparatively good than this one very disappointing ossam test but large chicken popcorn is not large i think because if you can purchase it from the kfc store offline than it will bigger kfc outlet takes a long long time to prepare my order when we got our order it was completely cold waste of money very hard chicken seems like old item is served after heating veg zinger mingal bucket packing very poor stale food bakwas 👍 that item delivered to me was so salted could not eat it theses ppl dont pick up calls plus they avoid cooking instruction you are charging 37 rupees for packaging charge does your papers cost 37 disappointing timely service 👍👍 quantity is not good as per price too much salty chicken strips and the lettuce used was old as well good 👍 all 👍 love the food here brbeing a complete bombay city person its hard to find delectable yummy food fantastic presentation and super service all under one roof brthis one has my heart and my tummy brsmoked chicken pasta the ravioli i also love the sunday brunches the pizza brstuffed chicken wings favouritest thing this place never disappoints i have been multiple times and the pasta pizza and even their soup is top notch visit for authentic italian food and great hospitality it was a great experience the ambience is very welcoming and charming amazing food and service staff are extremely knowledgeable and make great recommendations there are not any pan asian restaurants in bhopal but la kuchina is serving an amazing thai curryred with steamed rice hats off to the cook people who love thai food should give it a try for sure the place definitely deserves a visit if you are in bhopal we happen to drop in for a dinner and really liked the feel of the place this is definitely not the best food that you will have but good in comparison to the bhopals other optionsbrbri found the environment very cozy and comfortable the interior decoration was appealing and unobtrusive the soft music in the background added up to the charm service was punctual and courteous brbrfor the starter we ordered garlic bread and fresh lime soda garlic bread was good but i didnt enjoy the fresh lime soda that much probably the lemon was bitter for the main course we went for the usual vegetable pizza and aglio olio pasta with greek green salad the taste was delicious later we ordered something new like paneer shashlik with steamed rice which was equally satiating brbrthe taste lingered for some time in a nutshell it was another pleasant meal experience i would like to come again hands down best place to go to in the entire city everyone has a soft corner for italian food and god this place does it justice the ambience is just right giving you a comfy bistro feel with the music and everything staff is pretty courteous and overall the place has a very nice vibe to it best thin crust pizzas in the city amazing pastas i cannot state any one exemplary dish coz everything here is usually excellent their main course menu is varied with lots of flavours and the chefmanager will gladly help you pick something to your liking lots of wine options available too good for going on dates or even with friends and family highly recommended jehan numas shahnama had always been our family favourite and hence for a long time we did not try la kuchina but once we did we were in no doubt that its the best italian place in the town and ever since have visited it numerous times perfect ambience delicious food and prompt service do try their range of pastabreditedbri dont know why they have removed some of the best mexican dishes from their menu anyways on my recent visit i loved the shashlik so i tried this restaurant because of the amazing reviews and because i was staying in the same hotel in which it is locatedthe ambience and warmth of the staff is amongst the best daresay better than itc and taj levels they really welcome you and make you comfortable i tried just one dish the piri piri pizza which was good not outstanding but good nonetheless maybe my expectations were higher due to the reviews will definitely try their other dishes next time also ask for black pepper when there you will be surprised la kuchina has simply the best italian cuisine in whole of central india its a complete experience thats just amazing the service the food ambience everything is par excellence miss their chicken lasagna and await it to be added on the menu again their buffalo wings reminded me of the authentic buffalo wings which i was looking for since years the best and hatsoff to that the ambience was fantastic i ordered a mexican pizza and a plate of lasagne which are two of my favourites so my expectations were high considering it was a star hotel but the food let me down there was an open kitchen which was rare and interesting the lasagne was average and the pizza was really bad i read some reviews here but did not feel anything mexican in my pizza green chutney with the same old spices in indian sauces uncooked is not what i appreciated as i am foodie i was disappointed but if you really want to enjoy the grandeur of a star hotel you can give it a visit one of my favourite places server great italian food good ambience service can be slow sometimes overall a good experience best option for italian food in bhopal in my opinion d r e a m b o a tbrbrhow can anyone ignore this dreamboat could youbri know you guys cant😎 this boat is fully loaded with the dreams of a foodie who just adore hisher delicious tasty dessert and this time i came back with this shahi tukda mere 🧡 ka tukdabrraise your hand if

place for italian lovers the only decent place in bhopal for italian if you are looking for some wine and dine then this is the place to be ambience food service everything is pleasant we went to la kuchina on a lazy saturday afternoon the ambience is nice with good music but they could experiment more with the seating to make it look more authentic the pasta and seasoned vegetables on sides were yumm portion size is small and serves only one personservice was good and staff was courteous with ever smiling chefs we left the place satisfied and would like to visit it again ordered chicken lasagna thin crust pizza and blueberry cheese cake brbrchicken lasagna is highly recommended the blueberry cheese cake was excellent great ambiance and service the only place for authentic italian food in bhopal goan fish curry was very very bad and the fish was not good it was smelling bad wow what a fantastic place with marvellous ambiance and the chefs are of world class so their prepared food😊brfinest restaurant in the city of lakes “bhopal” ambience355 brfood 45brservice 45brpricing 55brour order was gnocchi and pizza along with watermelon lime martini the pizza was avg rest was delicious authentic italian food with amazing ambience and good music love to eat and hangout there one of a kind in bhopalbrcarbonara pasta and thai fried corn are my favorites no body serves italian as good as la kuchina jehanuma bhopalpizzas are to die for i am desperately waiting to have pizzas at la kuchina there is a mystical bond between food and taste and if ones get it at a same place its like heaven jehan numa palace is a perfect examplebrevery time i visit the place i fell in love with everything the restaurant the coffee shop or the heritage ambiance of the property this place still has no competitors in terms of the variety and authenticity of its offerings in bhopal because italian food is still not all that common here brbrbut their quality can vary greatly across dishes so its quite unpredictable for eg what we ordered was hunter lamb steak but what we got was a flavorless patty of minced lamb which can never qualify as a steak brbrhowever they made a good pepperoni pizza for which i might forgive them their mess of a steak the service and ambience are good and i like their interior decor fathers day brunch at la kuchina and it was an ok experience brbrto start with veggie harvest and mango mint juice didnt tantalize the taste buds at all pretty ordinary and bland for the most part including the presentation brbrspanish tortilla with hash browns and baked beans came to the table cold and chocolate chip pancakes could not even make it to the table for the entire course of the meal brbrwe never tried the soups in the offering but salads on the buffet were real nice fresh to an extent that you can feel the crunch even if you take it from the buffet and were dressed to perfectionbrbrolive caper and tomato dressed chicken crispy lamb noodles with bolognaise sauce were outstanding perfectly seasoned very plated and served at the right temperaturebrbrseafood risotto four cheese penne and pizza were as good as always brbrwhat dissapointed the most was the breakfast breads on the buffet as they looked and tasted were ordinary sugar free panacotta baked yogurt were real good correct texture right flavours and was just a perfect end that one would have wanted banana filled pancakes were served soggy and cold brbrfor the most part service is what was not upto the mark and it felt like it was due to the kitchen that was having difficulty coping up with an alacarte style brunch if it was a tradition live station on a buffet set up the service and overall experience would have been much better brbri am pretty sure ut will be much better next time the ambience is next to perfect the food is finger licking good also serves alcohol but the portions are ridiculous and its not reasonably priced this place is one of the most soughtafter restaurants in the city of bhopal the food is great and palate pleasing brbrhaving said that what the staff needs to work on is the decades old notions they are still following we were in a group of 3 with one male member and 2 females why is it a preconceived notion that if one scotch is ordered it will served to the male member of the group with out even asking who ordered what also the check was literally handed to the guy and wasn’t kept on the table as if women even today are not ready to bear the cost of a dinner we are in brbrthe food may or may not have scope of improvement but the mentality definitely needs to improve bhopals favorite eateries include the la kuchina i gave in to its hype finally visited it for the first time the staff was extremely courteous pleasant taking care of minute details about our preferences the ambience was good comfortable quiet the service was on the slower side in terms of time taken but the taste of the food made it up for it finally the food totally lived up to its hype expectations the soup was hot aromatic the pizza was soft fluffy hot very well made this is a place worth being recommended mamma miabrbrla kuchina was the best restaurant experience i had till date if you like italian food god has an answer brbrbeing a part of jehan numa top class ambience is expected and so is delivered the decor is admirable the waiters are attentive and are glad to suggest you delicacies music in background is soft and pleasing brbri had a penne alfredo veg shashlik and veg lasagne the dishes tasted as good as they looked every bite of em was savored no doubt they were the best in bhopal brbryou can order drinks too here but you wont have happy hours here like at tattenham jehan numas bar although wines are available at a discounted ratebrbrdo keep an eye on the todays special menubrdo not forget to have a look at the kitchen where you can see our so loved delicacies being prepared to tingle our taste budsbrbrthe only downside here is that the place is expensive a pasta can cost up to 700 rest apart this place is a foodies paradise brbrhappy hogging d came with a guest not from bhopal served with burnt margareta pizza and spaghetti felt like eating rubber band not happybr quality restaurant in one of the most upscale places in bhopal well set up la kuchina has a welcoming atmosphere the staff is very hospitable and the service is quickbrbrcoming to the food i dont think it lives up to the hype perhaps it is the best italian in bhopal but i have had better in other citiesbrbut keeping that aside if you go here with no background knowledge you will be bowled over we tried the veg piri piri pizza chicken sashlik and arrabiata pasta with chicken the pizza tasted nice though it had a slight resemblance in terms of taste to home baked pizzas the pasta was initially raw tomatoy but once we informed the management about it they replaced the dish and it came back better cooked and tastier the chicken sashlik was very tasty full of spices yet retaining its non indian lookbr i love this place be it quaint plush setting or the picturesque environment that makes you feel straight out of the movie set service seems to dawdle at times from quick and responsive to a bit slow at times nonetheless the time spent here is worth the wait last when i visited this place i had a spicy piri piri pino veg pizza the pizza was delightful thin crusted and baked to perfection cant wait to be here again its is located in jehan numa palace its a fine dine italian restaurant i visited in afternoon so lights were dim there was proper table setup on every table but it was very silent place no music i ordered chicken alfredo al forno all chicken pizza and lemon ice tea food taste and quality was unbelievable and amazing chicken alfredo al forno pasta was one of the best pasta i ever had beautifully presented they serve garlic bread complimentary overall it was very pleasant experience nice ambience good foodbrservice is amazingbrone of the premium places to go eat in bhopalbrhad bern here with friendsbrmust visit if you are in bhopal came here for a short lunch session with my friendwe were finely greeted by the staff and were offered complementary breadswe ordered cornandspinach and pastai loved the food over here ambience was good and music was just perfectlooking forth to visit again 😍😻 la kuchina a musy visit place in bhopal for italian food loversa perfect blend of good foodbest tasteand awesome ambiance dishes have the proper flavours and presentation is also gooda place worth visiting if you ever want to experience fine dining and the best italian cuisine in bhopal its la kuchina at jehan numa palace hotel that youve got to head to we havent seen fancier set up than this or such finesse in cooking either all throughout the capital city while we tried a wholesome bit of a lot of items what still lingers in our minds are a few thingsbrbrmiso potato and porcini soup with goat cheese cream and herb oil the delicately accentuated flavour the creamy texture and the whiff of shrooms just makes this soup probably the finest weve ever had anywherebrbrsundried tomato pesto gnocchi with cherry tomatoes and basil foam this ones no secret they restaurant is known for its gnocchi and hence we had to try it verdict must havebrbrof the other items were clear soup spinach and ricotta crepes mushroom and cheese stuffed cannelloni spinach and feta stuffed chicken and more which couldve been a little more flavourful but were delicious nonetheless brbrps the staff is very accommodating we asked if they could make our pizza half and half veg and non veg so as to enable us to try variety and they were happy to oblige the look and feel of the place is incredible but the food was subpar when i went the chicken caesar salad did not have proper caesar dressing the lettuce was not cut properly and the chicken was tasteless the portion itself was quite disappointing they went wrong even with the pizza something i did not know was possible before for the price the food really falls below the mark if im planning to invest in good food la kuchina will definitely not be on my mind again tried the chicken alfredo al forno pasta garlic bread and smoked chicken the dishes were amazing and offered exotic flavors all in all a great experience well after years of visiting jehan numa palaces coffee shop i decided to ring in the new year at la kuchina realised after eating the chicken shashlik that it was a poor choice on my part i dont generally have too big of a problem with undercooked food as long as when pointed out the staff changes it or asks me for another selection since that didnt happen im writing this review as a former hotelier i wanted or maybe expected you guys to be a bit more professional and proactive given how the gastro or the coffee shop staff is just bringing out the chef and having me repeat my problem will not make the problem go awaybrrequest you all to please keep this in mind for all future guests kudos to the rest of the team cheers want to have some authentic italianmediterranean in bhopal then this is the place to be mouth watering presentation and amazing taste ambience is very european and its a great place to have lunch service is neat and staff is well behaved and friendly i recommend this place to everyone definitely the most quality dining spot in bhopal their food is delicious and presentation is inspiring taste is authentic and quantity is good pricing is worth the quality of food i am going there since more than a decade i just love it restaurant with royal feeling and great taste bramazing ambiance quick service best in class had buffet lunch their and really fully satisfied with the food and service of this placebrwould like to visit in my next trip also smoked chicken carbonara thai green gravy stuffed chicken wings and any of the thin crust brick oven pizzas fixed brwine tastes better with la kuchina food trust me the place does not disappoint you ever consistent and scrumptious very well served by the excellent staff in the perfect the bistro ambience the food is appetising to the buds brdesserts are good have heard never triedbrone of the better speciality cuisine restaurants ive visitedbra thumbs up to this place italian part of the hotel during international pizza festival i ordered turkey pizza it was really bad and uncooked turkey chunks were raw and the crust was too thin there was hardly anyone sitting in the cafe expensive place best and authentic italian food in town we went with high hopes and la kuchina lived upto it the ambience was great service was prompt and courteous and the food was excellent reasonably priced for the food its quality for the ambience and the service the food reminded us the taste of tuscany adding a pic of cannelloni highly recommended and we look forward to visit again br ordered minestrone soup and pasta taste was yum and preparations were so fresh that added flavour to the food at the end had dal makhani and tandoori roti and they were yum too over all 55 for all parameters amazing experience every single time we visit this place the best place for italian specially the vegetarian pizza corn and tomato soup is delicious a must visit located within jehan numa palace it offers a good variety and great taste credit goes to the team to make you feel comfortable understand your tasterequirements perfectly well and get you the perfect dish kudos to the team they have removed most items what most regular customers liked if you have ever been to any authentic italian restaurant be prepared for a truly harrowing experience the level confidence in their incompetence is almost comic whoever designed the menu should be given a ticket to outside asapbr amazing italian restaurant at the palace\\u200b loved the ambienceit was a busy saturday eveningbut the order arrived on the table with bearable delaythe hunters lambwith smashed potatoes and spinach is 55 dont miss itthe chargrilled salmon missed was on the dry sidebut the spaghetti accompanied with the same made up for the missthey also serve you complimentary garlic bread\\u200b which you wont see in the pic as we finished the samebefore i remembered to take a pic br was a fan of the place before but my last experience was disappointing the ravioli i asked for seemed more like cabbage dimsums tossed in heavy white sauce brstill love their basil tomato soup really impressed with service special credit goes to vinod kumar saini he truly deserves a promotion because of his eagerness to serve loved it amazing food we ordered the mushroom trifolati as our starter and it was in an asian sauce soy sauce sugar sesame seeds so kind of not expected from the best italian restaurant in bhopal the draught beer tasted quite similar to kingfisher premium could be wrong about it the lamb steak was bang average which was completely ruined by the extra salty sauce i know at such restaurants we are paying for the ambience but to be honest the place can do so much better i expected the lake side view and what not but it was a small cafe type place and you could see the hotel guests checking in and out the only redeeming thing was the pesto pasta it was pretty decent but at such a place you just dont want decent food youre going their for amazing and great food we have been regular visitors to this place for ages with great experience always so many times we drive from indore to have lunch but today afternoon on sunday the experience was very bad theyve introduced sunday brunch with fixed menu and 2 very basic cocktails one with white rum and another with gin and draught beers the alcohol and ingredients used were very bad and the alcohol was almost nonexistent the food was very ordinary and the cocktails pathetic and priced at rs 1500 per head including taxes we felt cheated br the best place in bhopal where you will get great italian cuisines also the service is very good also the ambience and seating place is good when its about time dining jehanuma is the place to go no matter what you order they serve very authentic italian some of you might not like it because its that authentic i had a tomato pizza large and a soup waiters were very well behaved when they saw i have a baby with me they gave us complimentary baby food was feeling pampered great going guys want to visit the place again not a resident of bhopal but found this place a perfect place for dining in the city of lakes brfancy palace hotels make me go gaga over the beauty of the place brambiance was lively brthe wine bottles stacked on the wooden racks and the live kitchen made it attractivebrtalking about the food ordered chicken stuffed with spinach and feta oh so delectable it had a perfect blend of the stuffing inside and the chicken was perfectly cookedbrthai red chicken curry served with rice was good the portions were small brand sangria to complete my meal brbroverall a good option to dine in bhopal one of the best places in bhopal to have italian food spacious interiors and warm hospitality just adds to the good food they serve you wont get better italian and mediterranean food that this in bhopal absolutely delightful and i enjoy a meal here every single time ps you cant see the lake from here nor from any other spot in this hotel while to have found such stuff in bhopal is quite an achievement but still its a long way to go we ordered chicken salad garlic bread grilled fish and in indian preparation we had paneer makhani brbrsalad was not really upto the mark with very small portion of chicken in it the lettuce were not properly done eitherbrbrrest of the dishes were still ok i specially liked cheese garlic bread however fish could have been more juicy brbrservices were fine brbrgood ambience brbrvalue for money i dont mind paying premium price provided the dishes are worthy of it as i said immense scope of improvement in terms of preparation and then its worth every penny spent so for me atleast at this point of time its way too highly priced la kuchina is an amazing italian place at jehannuma palace hotelthey serve every nice italian foodi love the ambience of la kuchinathe service is also pretty nice and the staff is very courteousthey could include a little more variety in their menubrfun facta bollywood song from rajneeti was shot at this restaurant brhope this helpedhappy eating the only authentic italian restaurant in bhopalvery difficult to pick and praise selectivelytake your pick from the plethora of pastas and pizzas and be rest assured that you wont be disappointed this place takes you to a different country the moment i entered i was

doesnt like spinach crispy enough but oily which i expected it to bebrbr4 black pepper and walnut crusted chicken tenders i was disappointed could be because i expected a lot out of it my friends did

budsbrbrwith respect to price i found it a bit higher but the hole in the pocket wont pinch your heart for long because of the experience it wont matter a lot because they serve really good food with equally good service and ambience excellent restaurant for italian cousins exquisite interiors there is only one downside if you eat here you cant eat anywhere else in bhopal even though there is a fair repertoire of italian dishes there is a certain something lacking in authenticity for example how the carbonara on offer does not have bacon pancetta in itbrhowever its a very cosy location for having a night out with a pitcher of margaritas and some bolognese well la kuchina is a food place in itself all sophisticated and a fine dining place it makes you happy always and i mean itbrambience is so warm and welcomingbrstaff is courteous and welcoming to the corebrmusic is perfectbrand talking about the menu they just get it for you the way youll like itbrwe ordered for brspicy primavera pasta yes it was spicy as the name suggests and the cheese oh my god just takes your heart away it smells and tastes equally good the herbs and the tanginess of the red sauce combines well with baked cheese and the right amount of hotness to call it spicy if you are a person whos nose and eyes water with even a little bit of spice it isnt the dish for you its for hardcore lovers of spicy foodbrsmoked chicken pasta the tender pieces of chicken pasta drenched in white sauce and all creamy what else do you needbrbread was on the housebra pitcher of beer which was really smooth and sangria which just makes your daybra place to go sit and have a perfect date girls day out family lunchdinner or be it anything because its worth it visiting la kuchina always feels like you’re sitting in a cute cafe right in an italian street gnocchi is my favourite go to dish whenever i go there the food is amazing and authentic i have been a huge fan of this place but they have drastically reduced the main course portion size as well as the pizza base was burnt too la kuchina serves the best aglio olio we ordered lamb shank as well which was so tender and juicy we loved it also the staff was really polite i would recommend you to try the aglio olio and eggplant parmigiana undoubtedly jehan numa serves the best food in the city of lakesbhopal la kuchina their landmark italian restaurant is no exception it draws out foodies longing for authentic italian food from all across the townbrbri have been a frequent visitor for about 8 years now until recent times there quality of the food was top notch but one would always have to shell out big bucks for the mouthwatering food and service lately this place has become exceptionally pricey and also some of the dishes that we ordered we not up to the mark compared to what ive had here also the serving size has seen a drastic downward trend i dont know how the management hopes to maintain its hardearned reputationbrbrwell once here do try our the chicken lasagna it used to be to perfect but wasnt so appetizing the last time we tried it the thin crust pizzas are kind of affordable compared to the rest of the dishes but nonetheless it will leave your belly with loads of space as it is not very fillingbrbrfood 455brambiance455brservice 45brprice35brbr the one stop shop to feed your italian food cravings this is the place to visit very authentic and tasteful food here not to mention the hospitality is really nicebrbrall pizzas are just fantastic thin crust crisp and finger licking good pasta is equally good too specially the pestobr the place is nice and cozy it serves good food too the staff is courteous and mannered brbrwe ordered from make your selections a chef special indian which came as mutter paneer along with bread roasted papad and salad we also ordered thai curry red along with steamed rice the serving was nice and tastybrwe also ordered appetizer fish fingers which was fairly good along with fresh lime soda brbrthe total bill for two came to 2300 brbri find its a once a while place for the value we pay ajinkya mote the best restaurant in bhopal by a margin the food quality is absolutely excellent and i seriously do not think any restaurant can actually compete with it in terms of food quality situated within the jehan numa came out as a nice surprise for the cuisine served good fresh italian mediterranean food with a glass of draught beer to accompany we tried the broccoli soup which was brilliant in terms of taste served with freshly baked portions of bread taste was subtle and creamy loved it the black pepper crusted chicken was good but not exceptional we ordered the smoked salmon pizza and the all chicken one the norwegian smoked salmon was quite nice with the smoky salmon taste not necessarily overpowering the pizza perfectly balanced didnt enjoy the all chicken one not to my taste have to mention the roasted peanuts served with the beer the best i have had so far ever was locally sourced and yummy to the core la kachina is a restaurant located inside jehan numa hotel the restaurant offers very comfortable and cosy sitting ambience and serves continental cuisine their thin crust pizzas are out of this world plus they have a very different type of appetizers which one must try particularly their platter which has lebanese food have visited this place with friends and colleagues hard drinks are also served here once i had visited with my friend and did not find anything great to eat from the menu the chef came to our table and suggested something customized to us and it was absolutely amazing little expensive but food and ambience is worth the money the place probably has the best thin crust pizza in bhopal will definitely go there again just for it brbrhowever the second dish we ordered white sauce pasta was really bad it tasted too much of flour and was overly milky not even creamy it was tough to even finish half of it brbras far as drinks are concerned there version of singaporean sling is really good and worth checking out this is probably the best italian restaurant in the city of bhopal the chef doesnt look italian but he seems to think italianbrhe even seems to have noddles in his head and a spegetti brain try the zucchini parmesan soup if you dont believe me or nibble on a mozzarella gnocchi sorrentina while sipping a doppio caffee but wait a minute where did the grilled rack of new zealand lamb come from perhaps from the fabled italian south seas islands or the braised lamb steak maybe roman lambsbrand from the chicago mafia we have for you walnut pie and cheese cake mama mia this is one of those chic and fine dining restaurants in bhopal very elegant interiors and design there is an open kitchen and chefs are more than happy to cook to your tastes you can have amazing thin crust firewood pizzas and sparkling spinach i enjoyed the experience well its the same story i feel as with every over hyped restaurant the ambience was wonderful the staff was very good but the food was very average the pizza starters main course was not up to the mark what draws you to the place is what is hidden behind that little green door a tiny place but has so much to offer the only place in bhopal that specialises in authentic italian cuisine alcoholic drinks is limited to the menu but is refined and not adulterated so its absolutely fine best place to be for a quiet evening la kuchina has a standard very high for bhopal the gentry the standard of the staff the service the food the ambience the interiors everything is a class apart la kuchina is one of a kind place in bhopal and in my opinion the only place you can take your friends from out of town and not be let down by the localised service superb i ordered for lamb shanks in sauce and i have never eaten such great made lamb shanks my entire life you have just raised my standard of great taste my most fav thing here is the aglio olio spaghetti it is one of the best i have had ab tk it’s been years they taste is still the same such consistency a great outlet for italian food we order for a cappuccino of wild mushroom soup it was perfect with a very subtle but evident taste of mushrooms we tried garden vegetable pizza as the name goes it had broccoli bell pepper capsicum olives could baked it little crisper given that it was thin crust the sauce was dull which made it little boring also we had mushroom white wine pasta now this was perfect subtle taste perfectly cooked great food cutting two stars for their hurried service the restaurant was to shut which we understand which is why we had ordered everything at once we had not even finished eating and they brought the bill to us as if they just wanted to get rid of us and they kept on visiting our table again and again to remind us that the restaurant is shutting was really disappointed with their staff and service that day if they were that close to shutting they should have not given us a table in the first place but this behavior was abysmal i ordered insalata caprese and gnocchibrsalad was horrible no taste no dressingsimply cut 4 slices of tomato and 3 slide of mozrellabrbrno dressing no taste and quantity was like you will not realize when you started and when it is over 😑😑😑brbrgnocchi was also very rubbery at no point of time you realize that it is made of potato either restaurant make from floor instead of potato or so over noodles that potato tienes rubberybrbrmore over such preparation from a restaurant which enjoy 57 star catagory is not acceptable at such places we yearn for perfectionbrbri visited this place after long time and very disappointed due to crowd the stweards and waiters were disorganizedfirst they server salad along with main coursethen for bills 1 need to wait for about 15 minbrbrbhopal is way behind in terms of food quality taste and hospitality when compared to restaurants in indore while planning a rendezvous at bhopal with a batchmate from iit a few whatsapp exchanges had frozen the dinner slot on friday evening on picking me up he had offered a few options for the venue but jehan numa palace won hands down for its quality of food as we had experienced in our previous dinner five years ago in a not so agreeable climate of early june we had navigated through an erratic traffic of the city and on reaching the hotel premises handed the car keys to the valet parking attendant toying with the choices of indian versus continental food the latter had weighed heavier and we proceeded to ‘la kuchina’ a fine dining outlet for italian and other mediterranean cuisines brbrmy friend was ushered in with warm greetings by the manager and wait staffs as an acknowledgement of his frequent visits we settled down comfortably on a corner table within a largish dining space still quite empty at 830 pm the eatery was almost full within half an hour though the interiors of jehan numa palace were designed impeccably while highlighting the heritage characters of the property the elegant but not so resplendent décor muted lighting and heavy drapery all contributed in crafting an ambiance rich with legacy brbrthe maître d’ while noting our preferences politely suggested the items for catering to our tastes better for our choice of drinks i went for smirnoff with lime cordial soda my friend opted for the scotch black white with soda we asked for ‘prawns cocktail’ as the starter and one portion of the soup ‘chicken ginger broth’ to be shared by two of us the salad came with a good number of ‘tail on’ medium sized prawns and the soup tasted simply excellent with an exuding aroma for the main courses we chose ‘chicken saganaki’ with tzatziki sauce and ‘southern fried chicken with sautéed vegetables’ saganaki a rich tomatoey and typically greek preparation was served in a large quantity with chunks of chicken tzatziki sauce another mediterranean speciality prepared with strained yoghurt with cucumber garlic salt and olive oil has been extensively used for meat dishes and also as dip for the meats the dish while looking very healthy tasted a bit bland for our palates southern fried chicken came in the form of not so thick pan fried and thinly crusted boneless chicken fillets served with the plentiful of fried potato and sautéed broccoli beans etc we came back quite satiated promising to return in the near future to enhance our gastronomical delights brmy only regret has been that i had missed taking photos of the dishes served as were so engrossed in our journey down the memory lane brbrjehan numa palace has etched out a position of pride in the culinary map of bhopal with its exotic offerings to the denizens of the city i visited this place last year perhaps the best italian food i have ever had the open kitchen ambience is also nice little costly but that is worth certainly recommend it definitely visit again if i go to bhopal one of the best places to eat in bhopalthey have some of the best world cuisines but i wonder why they removed mexican dishes from their menui miss stuffed mexican chicken and mexican rice with almond gravyif u are a lover of italian foodu gotta go here gd food love the virgin cucumber mojito the ravioli soup the spicy pink primerievera the deserts and love the ambience too the staff is gd great experience thats the best place to grab some italian food the food is really good accompanied by great service this place has set a new bar for what we call food its a little low on seating not that spacious but got a table easily this is place is worth visiting for fine dinning they serve the best italian food in the city the ambience is very soothing and the staff is very courteous la kuchina is a part of jahanuma group of hotels and they are the only authentic italian restaurant and the best in town for their food quality and taste this place is serene and has different vibes which is sometimes spoiled by loud music in all i just love this placethey also keep organising pizza fests to serve variety those have always been good as far as charges go i wont say those are high because the kind of food is served its worth it all in all i think improvement can be done in the variety of drinks probably wines of different countries so on so forth its interior makes it look this place even more peacefulbr after a long wait they accommodated us in a rather full restaurant on a busy 31st december lunch the place was rather full with them having to turn away guests my eyes popped out on seeing dal and naan being served and khausuey and rogan josh on the menu in what is claimed to be an authentic italian restaurant but it seemed to work well to cater to different taste buds the bread basket seems a tad bit stale as the breads were not smelling fresh and right out of the oven the cheese on the breads also tasted like the britanniamother dairy kind of cheese rather than a good cheddarmozzarella any good italian caférestaurant always boasts of olive oil and a squiggle of balsamic vinegar at the table to go with the breads but that was missing the main course was authentic in the form of spinach stuffed ravioli and the grilled fish the servings were also rather big i wish they had touched up the rough edges and they would be such a star of a restaurant what lies behind that quaint green doorbrevery time i go to jehan numa palace i am really amused by the fact that the door to la kuchina remains closed like its hiding a wonderful secret inside and it really is a wonderful little space with an open kitchen and amazing hospitalitybrbrluxurious and high end from the food to the decor this place oozes sophistication and i hate to admit it but i tend to spend an extra half hour getting dressed if i know i am headed there for the nightbrso a favourite visited from the land of sheikssands and oil and we ended up at our yearly ritual girls night spot for some downtimebrbrla kuchina has a lovely drinks menu with a good wine list which we skipped on this particular nightbrthe food menu is italian heaven and one can compare the variety and taste to any high end italian restaurant in any of the big citiesbrbrwe walked into an almost empty room that was buzzing with energy from the kitchen and found our favourite corner spot to settle down at what i love about such places is that you dont have to worry about loud music or too many people and can kick back and have a real conversationbrbrwhat we orderedbr1 tomato and basil soup brcame in the prettiest bowls along with a platter of breads and tasted perfect tangy and creamy and warm was exactly what we needed in this weather and the undertones of basil in every spoonful was simply perfectbr2 whole wheat penne in pink alfredo sauce with chickena first time orderbrthe penne was perfectly cooked or should i say perfectly al dente the pink alfredo sauce well i could have bowls full of just the sauce for dinner and be completely satisfied the best pink sauce i have ever had the chicken was cut into bite sized pieces and cooked on point it wasnt as spicy as i would have liked but then a little chilli flakes fixed it for me and my friend who isnt a spicy food fan had nothing to complain aboutbrthe only thing i could nitpick about is that the pasta used wasnt all whole wheat only we definitely found a few not wheat penne pieces in our pasta but since we were enjoying our meal we chose not to complain about itbrbrthe meal was perfect the company even better and it was just a lovely night out we did not order dessert we decided to walk out to their coffee shop for dessertbrbrthe dinner costed us rs108000 which isnt value for money but not too heavy on the pocket for an upscale restaurantbrbrwhat i would recommendbr1 the tomato basil soup broccoli soup both are just perfect starts to a meal amazingly delicious wonderfully served and perfectly madebr2 the pastas and pizzas i have tried a few different ones on the menu and if i had to pick a favourite it would be the aglio olio and the alfredo pink saucebrwe ordered the gnocchi once and that was a disaster i am not ready to experiment with againbr3 the thai curry the best i have had till date in bhopalbr4 the wine list is worth a try they provide a larger variety than most places in townbrbra little piece of advice always order what you know you can enjoy and eat i usually order weird stuff off menus and experiment but this has been one place where every risk and experiment has been a big fail for mebrbri will definitely be going back for the food and vibe and the simple feeling of being in a super eclectic ambience because it just makes me feel betterbrbroverall experience brfood 910brambience 1010brservice 910brcleanliness 1010brprice 810 pleasant surprise brwas a little skeptical of ordering italian not understanding if it would be authentic brhowever since jehan numa food otherwise is amazingbrdecided to try la kuchina and the food was top notch great ambiance and awesome italian foodbrbrlove the food there the open kitchen and great service also adds to the overall experience brdo try their cheesecake and tiramisu i visited la kuchina with my family yesterday even after making reservations there was no table available we had to wait for good 20 minutes in between asking the manager to make arrangements quickly for a table once we finally settled down we had to wait for the waiter to bring in the menu and again wait another 20 minutes for someone to come take our orders even after telling the waiter that we are ready to place the order the food was good though and i ordered grilled river sole with smoked prawn image attached along with pizza and desserts but the service can be improved my stars are given only for the food im taking away the stars for the service provided we love coming here this time around we ordered just the pizzas and only the smoky chicken one turned out to be really good the lamb pepperoni one was average on another note must try the chargrilled fish yes your wallet should be heavy to dine at jehnumas but yet you donot mind spending when you get great appetite and hospitality with peaceful ambience jehnuma is brand in bhopal and it keeps living its mark everytime we dine at any of its outlet that is why for special occasions this is the place for our celebration you get vareity under one roof best place to have italian cuisine at city of lakes with not much in mind we headed to this place though the place was not that spacious but got a table easily it has open kitchen so you can easily glance at your food from your table side so we ordered for black pepper and walnut crusted chicken tenders which they served with some garlic breads this turns out to be delicious chicken breasts were tender as name said with perfect crispy fine coat of walnuts a special sauce was served which was very new to taste buds spicy primavera with spaghetti was the next choice which had nice blend of herbs olive oil and tomatoes to accomplish any italian cuisine pizzas are must so we tried four fourth pizza presentation was quite notable as each slice had different ingredients stuffed along with cheddar and feta cheese at the end surprisingly each stuff ordered was worth the money and pocket friendly best fine dining experience so far at bhopal thanks la kuchina team one of the best italian place in town for a quite lunch dinner the staff is hospitable and the ambiance is delightful would highly recommend the alfredo pasta and garlic bread ordered the broccoli soup corn and spinach starter and spicy piri piri pino pizza and the vegetarian thai currybrand sad to say but the soup was pretty much the highlight for a restaurant with such high reviews i was disappointed to find that the corn appetizer had too much oil the pizza was really not good with soggy vegetables and absolutely no spice at all the thai curry itself was alright but really who adds cottage cheese to a thai curry overall i certainly had higher expectations well what’s not amazing about this place just everything from food service ambience locationjust everything i am a regular visitor to la kuchina and what i love here most is its pastas especially ‘spicy primavera and chicken alfredo al forno’ these two are my favourites in main course infact i have tried pastas in many places in bhopal but this place serves the best ‘hand ground pepper prawn adana’ and ‘crispy fried corn and spinach with chilli dip’ are the most amazing starters here good food along with your favourite drink will make you fall in love with this restaurant it serves both alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages hence comfortable for everyonebrbrservice is quite quick and warm staff is friendly special attention to your likes and dislikes will be given here and the taste can be adjusted as per your requirements spicy non spicy bland some amazing desserts are served here and after a hearty meal you must relish on thembrbrthis tiny place has so much to offer and you will just love each and everything right from the quantity to quality everything here is on point infact this is the best place in town to have authentic italian cuisine a perfect dreamy place for those quiet romantic dates brunches family dinners and get togethers when in bhopal this place is a must visit italian brlook no furtherbrbest italian in town probably in mp too just guessingbrgnochhi spaghetti soups breads sun dried tomatoes service is great so is the food liked this place quite a lot on my recent visit to bhopal the garlic bread was particularly the show stopper for me very different and filling i just recommend them to not dilute the cocktails too much whats the fun in that deducting one point purely cos my sangria was way too diluted as one enters the restaurant one gets the feel of italy its a authentic italian restaurant serving delicious food we ordered pizza garlic bread and lasagne which was awesome brthou the food takes time to be served but its worth the wait i was very much looking forward to dine at much famed la kuchina some may know but many may not one of the scenes and a song from katrina and ranbir starrer rajneeti have been shot in this very restaurant onlybrat the outset i would like to mention that the staff barring the manager was over excited and concentrated towards foreign guests and showing little or no interest in the indians i hate such evident discrimination and i as well as indians on the other table also felt the same though the manager was courteous to ask us about our experience and confirm if we are treated well also from a restaurant of this stature i would have expected the staff to serve the food but that wasnt the case either service definitely needs a push here and thats why i am not rating this restaurant too high on a relative scalebrcoming down to food i had regular vegetarian pizza absolutely no complaints with the pizza perfectly cooked thin crust pizza with lot of vegetables exactly what i was carving for from a long time in bhopal then i had fresh lime soda which was not at all a fine dining experience very ordinary bra meal for one would cost around 700800rs inclusive of taxes which for such good food at an elegant restaurant is pretty decent had a splendid dinner here ordered spaghetti bolognese and chickenmushroom risotto the price might be a reach if you order alcohol too but a worth it experience i have heard a lot about this restaurant in bhopal so one day we decided to have our sunday nite dinner therebrambiance was good services were also goodbrwe had ordered itallian pizza and penne alfredo which were not that great bri was having high expectations as i have heard lot about it but was not that happy brexpectations increases as rates were very high but would say they do not serve authentic italian food brservices and ambiance was really good la kuchina is by far the best italian restaurant in bhopal and will be amongst the best in country right from the time you enter the premises you are warmly welcomed and restaurant manager takes personal care of you ambience is also very good and has open live kitchen you can see and smell the food being prepared by team of chef and cooksbri was there with my family and had ordered crispy fried black pepper chicken for starters along with beer and cucumber drink the chicken was mildly flavoured and was good brthen we ordered peri peri veg pizza which was also good along with spicy primavera pasta which was outstanding it tasted sobr good as it is so cheesy and perfectly flavouredi highly recommend la kuchina for being a out standing restaurant delicious exactly how i wanted my coffee was delivered even the customisation according to my dietary preferences were made which is commendable i really appreciate your understanding since the order was to be delivered at a hospital they provided additional plates as well im glad for such gesture no salsa with nachos just 10rs chips and cheese sauce theres a lot of scope to make the pizza better taste was good 810 but apart from it everything could be improved significantlybrbri did love the bun though what wasnt to love it was just soft bread filled withcheese or cream i was already sold on the concept brbrsorry couldnt include photos but pizza was okayish looking still tasty and the bun looked perfect one of my favourite places in town they take good care of the food quality hygiene their taste is delicious my personal favourite has been the mediterranean platter with wild grapes mocktail i also like their burgers alfredo pasta pina colada mocktail and cheesecakes the ambience is calm beautiful the owners staff are friendly and their service is excellent 100 recommended by me for those who want to have good food good time it wasnt good a great place with good food and cordial staff though some dishes are overpriced will definitely recommend it the only caveat is that they play only english cafestereotypical songs otherwise great i went there with my parents to celebrate their anniversary brthis one of the few pure vegetarian cafe in bhopal br i must they serve lip smacking food brthe ambience is very nice bri would highly recommend this place i personally felt that the first element which is brownie is overpowering the taste of the below elements that are cream cheese and base crumb also i didnt find the cream cheeses taste as its usually there in no bake cheesecake the packaging is good and quantity and pricing are justified just a bit of extra effort on taste donut is messed in package and pasta was too spicy arrabiata was lil too spicy brbrbrbut cold coffee just awesome pasta was good but brownie and sandwich was below expectations this is my first order i must say that the ice cream proportion was very less i cant even find that you have to make your coffee a little bit thick and strong again want to add that with ice cream means with ice cream dont put just for a sake thank you but im not happy with it i hope this feedback will be fruitful for you and youll improve the same spinach should have been a little less last weekend i visited this place to celebrate my cousin birthday party heres service is good and staff are really friendly with their customers if you are looking for good service and friendly staff restaurant then must visit this place too much oil in thai curry coffee tastes weird lasagna was ok but the accompanying bread was of bad quality the cheesecake could have been packed with a lid in a tighter box it was spilling out as we opened the box delicious food brbrbut please mention the name of the product like cold coffee or frappe on the glasscup plsbrbecause its impossible to recognise which one is cold coffee and which one is frappebrbr tres leches from your cafe is the worst ive ever had the soaked cake was a pathetic creamsoaked mess and the milk was tasteless nothing compared to the actual taste of condensed evaporated and creamy milk brabsolute waste of money i am never ordering anything from this cafe its a waste of a place yummy all food br they didnt even send a happy birthday tag or anything thats just basic i received lasagne without cheese only pasta sheet and little bit stuffing off 350 rs 😡😡 that too was not fresh the sandwich fillings were stale cheesecake slice is not fresh overpriced and not good in taste i need refund because i didnt get cold coffee brwhich i ordered loved the desserts sweet the bread was not toasted the food here is really nice and not overpriced too this is one of the perfect cafe from food to service everything is very good both cheese cake was stale and smelly the quantity was extremely less and the packaging was not good either for something thats priced at rs 380 soft and oliy bread and shit pasta worst food and beverages very overpriced food was worth only 25 of the price they are charging dj creates noise outdoor sitting is not good either cheap people come there no prawn no fish goof cafe but little expensive and quantity is less our order got delayed as the chef burnt the first pizza and no one informed us the same while we waited there clueless for quite some time and lost our appetite but as this is a special case it wont change the fact that the restaurant has good ambience food and service it was a good experience you can try it service and members were polite and good bakwas taste tha shahi paneer jaisa nai lagabahut hi kharab taste hainever going to order again from this placehigh price and not at all worthymoney wasted pathetic service we had to ask the staff to make the hookah right thrice iced tea tasted like peach tea crispy corn were okay they gave us a complimentary hata bhara kabab which was very okayish too staff is quite uninterested they also overcharged us we asked for normal base hookah and they added milkbase additional charges in the bill never going back here very good food great taste but definitely on the expensive side when it comes to size of the portions food was very spicy had a bad experience ambience was below par washroom was unhygienic great ambience and food it was great and the staff was friendly and very courteous the ambience is great also the staff is quite friendly and service was great would definitely recommend for small friends catch up lovely food at latitude cafe brservice boy ramesh yadav was good as well br food was delicious and ambience is also good not

place to hangout with friends and to celebrate birthdaysdue being a roof top restro the pictures also comeout to be awesome would definitely recomend to other ppl good restaurant food is nice service was excellent anjali thakur delighted us with the extraordinary service very bad service and food is the worst i ever have in bhopal its just a waste of money a nice place with a nice ambience and great food and very polite staff food was good except gulab jamun ambience was acceptable worst experience at this stupid restaurant with such untrained staff they don’t know how to talk to customers especially their manager they overcharged us horrible food and horrible service all food was bad bad service and bad quality great food but please package the curry boxes better as oil begins to leak from the side narottan served us nicely and was very polite good food ramij and sanath good service thank you very much ramij we enjoyed your food choices and thank you very much for such a nice service we will come again good food and service brbr if you want authentic italian food look no further great taste at reasonable rates there was a genuine need for authentic italian cuisine in bhopal now the search is over they even have jain and vegan options ramij is goodservice ambinece taste all is good ramij good sv yummy food service was hood ambiance too just wow i highly recommend this new italian place in e2 bhopal they have vallet parking so it’s quite convenient they have wide italian menu and brief india menu too for those elderly people in your family who prefer indian food brbreverything we ordered was so fresh and delicious specially appetizers we tried ravioli pasta and sicilia pizza in main course their chef’s special risotto is a must try in mocktails ‘nice and naughty’ is heavenly dessert we tried were mouthwatering blueberry cheese cake and sizzling browniebr brthey have a huge party space as well with beautiful ambience broverall a great experience worth every penny real italian food italian food means little italyrisotto is superb ive been a patron of little italy for many years and i was thrilled to see them open a branch in bhopal the italian and mexican cuisine here is as authentic and delicious as it gets however the bhopal location takes the ambiance to the next level with its cozy chic interior and ample space we hosted a family gathering for 12 and everyone loved the food the service was also impressively quick i highly recommend trying their woodfired pizzas garlic bread and risotto a mustvisit spot for food loversbr aglio olio was awsome loved the restaurant amazing authentic italian food and great ambience finally finally a full vegetarian place with such an excellent taste i would always try these recipes at home so that my mother could try them as she is hardcore vegetarian and wont even enter a place that serves both veg and non veg but at home they are not as authentic as you want them to be the vibe is just beautiful the taste is amazing and almost authentic i love the place although i found prices a bit high but i get it the owners have to make profit and the ingredients used are expensive and not many people are acquired to try new food kudos to the owners for such a brilliant concept in bhopal i suggest everyone try this place ramij good job narottam shashikant’s attends very well the food was amazing but the quantity was less ambience is good but expecting non veg food also service 45brqualitytaste 355brvalue for money 45brambience 45brbrwent for dinner few days ago we ordered caprese pizza napoli pizza manali and pasta barberescabrbrcaprese it was disappointing did not have even a bit of flavors or seasoningbrbrpizza ordered half of pizza napoli and pizza manali taste wise it was fine but was a bit overdone in the oven and you could tell easily from the toppings the onion in the toppings felt more like they were pulled out while frying for a gravybrbrpasta barberesca pasta was perfectly cooked al dante and not overcooked white sauce consistency was perfect one or the better pasta in the city would definitely recommend to trybrbrprices are decent would love to visit again i recently dined at little italy and had a wonderful experience the cozy atmosphere set the perfect backdrop for a delicious meal i loved the aglio olio e peperoncino pesto pizza the service was attentive and friendly enhancing the overall experience highly recommend for anyone craving authentic italian cuisine in bhopal 🫶 ramij bhai nice sv love it great food and vibes great service by ramij sanath and narottam ramij was really nice and welcoming served us properly overall experience was great little italy is a mustvisit for anyone craving authentic italian cuisine in a relaxed and welcoming environment the food was good and tasty 😋 one and only option for authentic italian lovers the food and drinks are expensivebrthe bill was wrongly charged and due to online payment there was no compensation refund for the same the taste was also the same between two recipes of fish fish finger fish amritsari had a good time due to good company but the restaurant was not at all up to the franchise expectations request the management staff to be honest to their customers very nice 👍 food is really good music is nice the staff is super friendly and the place is a much visit very pathetic service i have never experienced such a poor service ever in my dining experience the server was totally absent minded and not at all trained there was just 2 server for an entire floor the order was taken and served after an hour this includes drinks too the tables are in poor state and not suitable for kids food variety is limited very slow service prem narayan the manager was very good awesome food and ambiance recently i visited the taj and had lunch at machan its situated in a stunning location with a beautiful view of the lake making it an ideal spot to enjoy your meal however while the machan interior isnt particularly aesthetic the food is authentic and satisfying the cocktails were definitely worth trying and the service was commendable although the food could have been better overall it was a pleasant experience called twice to book buffet lunch for an occasion they confirmed our booking and informed 2 plus 1 offer on the day of occasion we called to confirm our tables again this time they informed me there is no buffet today and you can order a la carte brvery unprofessional behavior that ruined our plans for the occasion the dinner spread is extensive and of high quality theres north indian east asian continental and lebanese on offer chaat starters and desserts are lovely it is a great place to have a fine evening together thank you taj for adding a jewel to this citybrmust visit this place thanks to the staff who makes it more beautiful we had opted a la carte the food is good but had very limited options in both paneer chicken main course the ambience is very good however theres no provision of breastfeeding room and my wife had to sit in spa for breastfeeding such the food was great we ordered risotto pizza burger liit everything was good the service ambience was great too must visit well the truth is its way to much overhyped no flavours no varietyover priced non veg was pathetic even a 15year boy can cook better by watching on youtubeshame good as pr pices brgreat tasty 😋😋 worst mouth watering taste cant wait for next order and test potatoes were not cooked properly out of 2 chicken pieces in the biryani 1 is so small that it would be better if you give only 1 piecebrthe taste and quality both have deteriorated very blend food potato missing brsad food was not what we excepted when it comes to kolkata

place in the city of lakes… tasteless very disappointed by the quantity of food which was up for take away quality wasn’t even sufficient for 2 people brkindly do take care of the quantity for the future which should atleast justify the pricing it was so good ❤ loved it tasty food ambience and service is good brbut food quality is not worth the risk brbrwe were served with butter paneer masala

comes to the holy trinity of fine dining perfect food perfect ambience perfect company brthe sheermal is something to die for the rogan josh is cooked with so much love it simply overflows with the wind whispering in your ear subtle music in the air this place is a must visit if youre in bhopal very well maintained hotel and restaurant as wellbrbrbeing a resident guest i utilised the facility for dinner as well as breakfastbrbrdinner i did not like rajma that i ordered for dinner so much it was not too authentic a preparation and cardamon plus a couple of other ingredients were overpowering the tastebrbrbreakfast very strong spread of buffet with a good mix of regional and international veg and non veg hot and cold options definitely liked itbrbrambiencebrbrmy recommendation is that if the weather permits one must eat in the beautiful verandah overlooking the lakebrbroverall a good experience excellent staff ensuring that you are well taken care of awesome place royal treatment royal feel the food is light that u will not realise how much u have eaten but i am little disappointed with the taste of food being north indian myself i was hoping for traditional royal taste but it was missing noor us sabah cafe latte is highly priced and the menu shows that the rates include taxes but when i went their and ordered energy drink which is written in the menu as shown in the third image it wasnt available and secondly i ordered a wrap but that was also not available and even the hookah was unavailable so i just ordered a regular sandwich and diet coke and when i asked for bill 18 tax was charged no gst number was mentioned in the bill this is really so shameful and so unprofessional noor us sabah should stop fooling people around i treated my extended party to dinner at marble arch we were seated in the garden with a beautiful view of the lakebrbrwhat i likedbr1 i had requested for a wheelchair for one of my grandparents in advance and the staff obligedbr2 i also had two guests with a gluten amp dairy allergy so the manager was extra careful about their food the chef himself came out to tell us what glutendairyfree food options were availablebr3 we ordered veg kebab platter kadhai paneer navratan subz bread baskets and kulfi the food was exquisite chefs kissbr4 the service staff although a little slow was very politebrbrwhat can improvebr1 our fresh lime sodas and desserts took a loooooooong time to arrive which was a little embarrassing for me in front of my family we had ordered some onion kulchas at the very beginning which arrived so late that everyone had almost finished eatingbr2 the service staff needed a little more training i asked them twice to bring me physical food menus so that some of my non techsavvy family members would find it easy to order they just nodded yes and continued to setclear the plates completely ignoring my request shrug br3 the lighting was so dim that we almost couldnt see what we were eatingbr4 after dinner i spoke to the manager and complimented their food and service but i also mentioned the last three points the manager seemed to have excuses for everything for example we put fresh lemons in fresh lime soda we had to defrost the kulfi these things take time etcbr5 this restaurant is listed under the zomato pro category but the manager told me they dont accept payments through zomato probrbrbrtldr great food polite service staff service can be quicker a multi cuisine restro of noor us sabha hotel visited almost 20 times for our 4 day stay here they have wide menu to choose from and have indoor and beautiful outdoor breath taking view of lake seating quality food served by their courteous staff a sure visit for all tried this place while visiting bhopal for a business trip it is an old haveli converted to a resort brthe restaurant does feel old but has the charm of its own seating outside with a view of the lake is surely worth tryingbrthe food was equally awesome food and a very cordial server bronly flaw is that they don’t serve beer 🍺 otherwise on a pleasant evening this is a must visit dining option i would start with the view its superb the lake looks beautiful i would have enjoyed am outdoor which was closed due to the rains but the tour inside was great also the staff is courteous friendly and helpful to start with appetizers both chinese and continental soups were up to the mark we had kebab starters the ajwain fish is a must try herebrthe biriyani was ok i would say its subtle but could have been more flavourful in desserts i tried the shahi tudka which was amazingbroverall a lovely dining experience would surely visit again theres no better way to start or end your day in bhopal then to get a lakeview breakfastmunchies at marbalarch restaurant situated inside noorussabah palace nice place ambience was goodstaff there is very nice and service is fastbrgreat place to have lunch with your girfriendbrone advice never take anarkali ki pasand it was the worst thing i every had good place for relaxation and located away from dust pollution and traffic but quality of chappati and naan are very badi hate it they used mixed white flour and very little amount of wheat had dinner here after 6 years and the taste and ambiance still remains the same paneer tikka was the best amongst all and the dahi kebabs tasted good as well had a chance to stay in this wonderful property noorus sabah in bhopal n i must say its one of the most beautiful views of the great lake in bhopal the sunset was just amazing and we just kept staring at the different colors of sky bri had a chance to savour two breakfasts plus a lunch at this marble arch restaurant the place is neat and the breakfast spread is just like any 45 star hotels the outdoor seating was cool when it was overcast n we enjoyed the lovely views from our table brthe lunch was good and the tastes were different we ordered chicken tikka masala fish curry and some mutton roghan josh the service was good n the feerni for deserts was good too brforgot to mention abt the galauti kababs n lachha parathas we had in breakfast it was really succulent m good taste also tried the mutton paya which was good n different from the delhi wala recipe brnot to forget the awesome bhopali chai we had continuously there also had a chance to meet the owner kaleem miyan who had lots of nice stories to tell abt the food n city of bhopal broverall an amazing experience at the palace welll the name says it all although they have competitors and they r still struggling for the taste but the marks they get it for their awesum location noor is peaceful though it lacks professionality as compared to jehnuma the service has worsened and the staff was very incorporate the food was not good at all i was priced more than what was written in the menu and the staff really was very unprofessional i have visited the place for 4 times and this was the worst experience dont believe the ratings given because these are all fake and the staff forces you to rate full star well how can you make the guest wait about 30 mins for starters in a buffet its beyond me how this beautiful setting can attain such low standards of service food menu compositon and overall feelbrbrfood starters once came tasted good main course selection was a big dissapointment and desserts were actually a shame this place is just a big 3 on the generous side delicious buffet with breathtaking views of bhopals upper lake airport and swimming pool all amid luxury of heritage the nihari dosa jalebi and poha are really good service is courteous and fast noor us sabah is great luxury property i loved the ambience herebrbr i loved the beautiful view from my room great breakfast buffet the food was served fresh brbrand great qualitybrbri would like to come here again with my girlfriend and other friendsbrbr5 stars the best food in bhopal noor us sabahbrbr simply wow amazing place amazing location spectacular view cool weather sunny day every thing was simply amazing i had peach ice tea chicken alanusp minced chicken sauted with lots of thyme other herbs filled inside of chicken breasts presentation service both were really very good very delayed services was observed roti was not available at the time of taking food from buffet very limited buffet non availability of service staff at the time of food service very huge charges i wondered what ailed such an amazing restaurant as i made my way through a heritage hotel silent and vacant not much fan fare as compared to the other heritage hotel of the townbrit all became quite clear as we got our first serving of the starters tasteless and nothing unique followed by equally sad layout of main course non veg not really feeling fresh dishes either over or undercooked sad state of affairs in vegetarian section decent breads though but appalling desert spreadbronly thing worth while was outdoor seating which must be charming during eveningbrslow service and nothing worthwhile to make a visit again a great waste of opportunity for them and money for us i had pre booked the place and went with my family ordered laal maas egg curry chicken curry honey chilli potato green salad and small bread basket only laal maas and honey chill were good other then that egg and chicken curry was sweet although we have mentioned that it needs to be spicy the cost for dishes were much higher as compared to the portion provided i would not suggest to go for lunch or dinnergo for coffee or snacking and enjoy the view otherwise it will be waste of money a legendary restaurant this place has a distinctive aroma of its ownwhich lures you moreservice is quick and food is great with lots of options from both indian and continental the pasta is damn tasty especially penne ala arabiatta give that a try picturesque ambience aroundfall in love with the place cheers and i am not exaggerating at all such is the aroma emitted from this restaurant excellent services excellent food i was charged more than written in menu and the experience was really bad best bhuna gosht in ages with a lovely ambience had lasooni jhinga garlic prawns boti kabab chicken karhai and the bhuna gosht both mutton preparations were great service is also very good service was great mr arvind with mr ashok is too professionally and love the waybthey handle everything its a good experience the buffet variety is small but the outdoor seating arrangement by the pool is nice went to this restaurant as i was staying at this hotelbrthey had a south indian theme for dinner brmost non veg dishes were rendition of cuisine of kerala i particularly liked their mutton preperation the mint flavoured biryani so typically south indian and the refresing lemon rice sweetdishes were great toobrthe flip side is that the dosa was served cold and the mysore pak was nowhere near perfct it was too hardbrbut i do not mind trying them out again for the foodbrtheir staff was very friendly great ambience and seating was very comfortable nice ambiance good service such a delight it was to be there😊 a beautiful property which was well taken care of and a lot of options to dine they have a cafe along with restaurants for different cuisinedo make a reservation 🍔🍲🍜🍕🍝🍗 beautiful location presentable staff and a lot of options to click pictures 📷brthe food was great and so was the service there is not much difference in the pricing from other restaurants plus they are offering a beautiful ambience and location totally worth it 👍🤘🏻if you are in bhopal definitely try heregreat food location and an amazing experience biriyani is the must try dish polite n well groomed staff but little late in serving food but in that time one can spent time getting bewitched with amazing breathtaking view✨💫 awesome staff and servicesmr ashok served us very well methi chicken was under cooked and was very hard to chew highly disappointed even after paying this much need improvement not bad but not the 5 experience i was expecting the menu uploaded here is old the food is really like any other good restaurant nothing too authentic or unique as you’d expect from a 5 super amazing view one of the best especially in monsoon with a slight drizzle the food is good too especially the pasta also try the chocolate truffle pstry shear disappointment had buffet the starters included all tandoori items no variation all tasted same main course was horrible not even one dish worth eating not recommended at all outstanding located within one of the most prominent heritage hotel noorussabah the hotel is on top of a small hill sitting arrangement of restaurant is on green lawn with lake view is awesome experience food is delicious and service is good food quality was not that good for which it was hyped waiting time for your order was more than half an hour that too when you gave your orders half an hour before so you

stunning lake view at reasonable price amidst luxury of heritage and courteous service noor us sabah palace one of the most exquisite hotel properties of bhopal houses the marble arch restaurant which serves traditional north indian cuisine with a focus on specialties from the kitchens of the erstwhile nawabs of bhopalbras soon as you enter the palace one gets the old school vibe of a well preserved heritage property the restaurant overlooks the famous bada talaab and has a gorgeous view as the palace is situated on the hill topbrthe staff is courteous and very hospitable for our lunch we ordered the bhopali murgh rizala a curry dish with authentic local flavours alongwith tandoori rotis which go very well with it we also ordered the dum biryani which was one of the most aromatic biryani ive had in a while the chicken was very well cooked and was quite tender the biryani is served with a refreshing raita with a hint of mint in itbrthe overall dining experience was quite satisfying and i would strongly recommend that anybody in and around bhopal must visit this place for the sheer experience of having authentic bhopali food in a beautiful heritage palacebralso the

of a tomato flavourand more of other spices tasty food so far this is one of the best place to dine out 👍👍 not good in taste chicken quality was also not good only bones and shredded pieces was their not worth 400 good quality got the wrong order with no salt in gravy food was tasty but can be further improved excellent extremely dry kebabsnot at all worthybrbrbhuna gosht was bad recipewith shimla mirch none spicy and kinda sweet typical biryani its very oilyi think another 2dish can be made by the left over oil its more like chicken pulav than a biryani still taste good smelly worst taste of khichdi dont recommend any one to go with the meal from restaurant good quality and good taste 👍 it was less chicken tikka masala and more like tamatar tel masala too much oil less chicken that too very bad quality good food great on time delivery unwanted veggie burnt onion just try to learn from berouz biryani the food is fabulous it was hot thanks for the good meal will order again uncooked chicken the chicken pieces was not at all tender it was very hard to chew the quantity of chicken pieces is too expensive for the price ordered veg biryani and received chicken piece in it the taste was good and biryani felt very light to eat added capsicum and too much oil despite specific instructions as expected from mehfil e dawat good taste food ordered navratan korma taste was on point its not a biriyani its a chicken rice that too tastes soo bad extremely costly taste like 100 thela biryani 400 me kya to loota hai bro koi mat lena yaha se ye charge wo charge 140 ka tikka 400 me chipka diya bhai frot hai ye to they mixed chicken pieces with my mutton order as if i wont know brbrstop fooling your customers bronce a customer is lost hes lost forever what kind of packing is this you need to improve in taste because its salt less chicken curry was okay okay food was super nice but the chicken was extremely cooked which made piece shred all over left with no gravy after eating this i got loose motion the spring roll was not cooked properly some portions were still raw besttttt everrrr cooked deliciously 🙂 ordered chicken manchurian but received veg manchurian very well filled

win for any customer totally bland and tasteless and in a liter of cream soup worst taste amazing productbrthe quality was amazing delicious taste always the taste of biryani and chicken tikka is awesome we ordered many times and are really very happy with taste and portion size not that kind of dish which i expect when i order from med i think they forgot to taste themselves after making

highly recommended chicken was okbrrice were stale and unbeatable disappointed lovely tastebrvery well cooked and fresh masala used preparation of the food taste all is the very good overall very delicious food i definitely recommend others for this resturant poor taste namak to tha hi nahi aur sabzi bi kacchi thi not good best and authentic malai paneer in bhopal packaging was superb but inversely the biryani taste first in dum biryani sella rice should not be used it should be basmati and secondly the recipe of biryani was not at all upto the mark good taste recommend i had a pleasant experience with memsaheb recommend this place for both ordering in and dining experience i like their dahi kebab chicken shami kebab dahi puri shots millet noodles and fish chilli please work on training your staff a little more as that would make the whole customer experience all the more smooth and worth it poor quality and samosa are not properly cooked worst experience it was disappointing to see cockroach on the naan we ordered that too cooked with it the hygiene checks need to be done for this place heybri did a takeaway on 17th feb ordered kasundi grilled fish and fish

itt great food and quick service fresh ingredients used awesome very good service and good food we were staying at noor us sabah property and obviously wanted to explore ming dynastywhich is their oriental restaurantbrthe pricing and the quality of dinnerware doesnt go hand in hand i was surprised to see the soup being served in a melamine bowl the melamine is a toxic material and should not be used for any hot item this is a luxurious hotel the pricing is all triple figure and the basics are so not in placebrbrfood the chicken soup was tad salty though they changed it the fried rice and chilli chicken were allright nothing extraordinarybrbrambience i have given the starts for the ambiencebrbrservice goodcan be greatbrbrvalue for money bad not worth it awesome ambience and service really like the view and food staff is very polite and humble i love everything about this place😇bri had a wonderful experience the visit was pleasant initially however it started deteriorating when hair was found in the food out of concern the strand was kept aside to show the team on ground however the captain said that theres no wet curry around the hair this shows the cheap standards at mings dynasty though the faulty one has been replaced it has killed our pleasant experience excellent service with delicious food an evening spent well very impressed with the overall experience amazing super slow service brfood was ok nice place and scenic view superb thanks alot very nice honey chilly potato was pathetic and veg fried rice was average if possible need refund the portion size was so small little noodles 2 dumplings not worth the prize the taste was garlicky good the soup was appetising its very big and very tasty best restro😁😁 very salty chicken pieces undercooked and very less gravy not at all satisfactory crispy soft and so good loved it 🤤 u nice nice preparation very very less potion sizes the food smelled bad very less portion size this noodles dumpling soup dish should

resturant delivery timing keep it up ordered japanese rice rice is undercooked it was a superb experience celebrating my birthday on 260815 at momo cafe brwe had gone for the buffet lunch brfirst of all we were amazed to see the wide variety offeredbr4 types of starters veg non veg then some kinds of exotic breads brthen the chilled salads and sproutsbrsome continental cuisinesbrthen the main course veg non veg brand at last the desserts the most lovely part brchocolaty desserts took my heart awayi loved them all this at 900 for twobramazing experience overall 😊😊😊 brps i forgot to mention 2 kinds of yummy soups 😊 very good fine dine restaurant sunday is the most important day of the week well at least for me people who know me also know the fact that while i used to live in bangalore i used to go for breakfast hopping on every sunday sadly we dont have the concept of breakfast cafes in bhopal but thank the lord that there are brunches sundays are one of those days that we tend to skip the breakfast time and we look forward to lunch at early hours hence we have something called as brunch which does the job of both brbri quiet like the concept of sunday brunch as that particular day you get to spend time with you family and friends over good food and drinks one can just not complain of not enjoying their sunday brunch or there is nothing that will interest them you sure have so many options to explore and hog around the placebrbrrecently i was invited to experience the sunday brunch at momo cafe courtyard by marriott bhopal for those who know dont know much about me this place has a soft corner in my heart as i started my career from this place as an intern my first vlog was also for marriott so now you know why i love marriott brbrthe smart folks at courtyard marriott decided to organize the brunch live counters and buffet spread completely indoors this means that the dessert counter greets you at the entrance of the restaurant and you know right away what you want to keep space for brbrchaat counterbrbrapart from the eye catchy dessert counter next thing to catch your attention is the lovely chaat counter serving absolutely lipsmacking chaat such as dahi puri pani puri chole tikki papdi chat bhel puri etcbrbrsalads brbrthe salads and cold cuts are my favourite way to start on a buffet i absolutely loved the variety of salads that were on display i particularly loved the caprese salad radish salad greek salad and broccoli peanut fete saladbrbrdrinks brbra brunch is incomplete without good drinks to accompany your meal i was served with a customised mocktail named orange shooter which was tangy and sweet if youre not very keen to go in for drinks which i recommend you should give a go you can try out the soups along with a variety of breadsbrbrgrills the starters brbrcontinuing my culinary journey of a perfect sunday with a delectable and exquisite brunch i next moved to live grills and starters you have a plethora of choices including live grills chinese and indian starters choose your own vegnon veg and let the chef do the magic for youbrbrstarters included marriotts signature galoutte kebabs which are cooked using high temperatures in the tandoor the flavours which emerge are a delicious combination of smoky yet subtle while the textures are rich soft and succulent shezwan potatoes which were boiled potatoes made in shezwan sauce and garnished with sesame seeds very similar to honey chilly potatoes but not very sweet fried rice the quintessential chinese favourite veggies chopped into juliennes a whole lot of spring onions and some soy sauce tossed together with steamed rice and creamy potatoes well wasnt the real name but this tasted absolutely brilliant creamy and cheesy flavours blending well with the boiled potatoes and grilled in oven brbrmain coursebrbralong with the indian meal that im going to describe below i also called in for pasta arabiata from the live pasta counter unfortunately i was so hungry that for once i forgot to click a pictures of a few things thanks to anmol for sending me some of the pictures but let me assure you that the italian counter wont disappoint youbrbraloo hing hara dhaniya stir fried potatoes with aromatic masalas lemon juice ginger chillies and with a pungent taste of hing a perfect dish on the sidebrbrmix vegetable a tangy tomatoes gravy crunchy onions and a basketful of colourful veggies with indian masalas you get a tonguetickling delicacy that is hard to resist brbrpaneer lababdar paneer cubes in an aromatic spicy gravy with sautéed onions kasoori methi and a hearty dollop of cream and butter paneer lababdar is sure to be the highlight of your mealbrbrand then came the chef with a surprise brbra bowl of bread dipped in niharibrbrtheres a special nihari section and guess what theres an option for both veg and non vegbrbrfor a person like me who is trying hard to go towards complete vegetarianism its even more harder to resist the fragrance of the dishes that you used to love having in the past well if i cant consume nalli nihari i sure can consume veg nihari which is basically spicy and flavourful stew and loved it when it was served with breads dipped in it brbrdal panchamel and dal makhani dal panchamel or dal panchratna a wholesome combo of five dals is flavoured with a special masala water and whole spices as well not only the flavours of the spices but the flavours of the assorted dals are also discernable in this delightful dish talking about the dal makhani which is made with red kidney beans and black gram it was cooked with plenty of butter and selected spices which make it rich creamy and delicious let me tell you one more thing with my past 4 years of dining experience at marriott bhopal this place never disappoints when it comes to dal makhani and i can even assure you with the fact that you cannot find a better dal makhani in whole bhopal i always end up having 2 bowls of it because its absolutely heavenly brbraloo methi ki tahiri one dish wonder made with rice methi and potatoes in aromatic indian spices and it’s prepared from scratch – no ready made or the store bought masalas here this main dish is full of flavor and texture but i found it very average for i wish there was biryani on the buffet that they specialise in brbrdesserts brbrtake a look at the dessert spread it is smartly set up just after the elevator and is the first thing you see you will instantly know what to keep room for or even what you want to start withbrbrno better way to end the feast with exquisite and alluring desserts which were handcrafted to perfection this was my favourite section from the whole brunch and i tell you there are so many options that you cant decide what to savour and what to put down brbrthe mini cup cakes were so cute and pretty that i fell in love with them red velvet chocolate chip minion cup cake and vanilla flavoured happy sunday cupcakes are the star of the dessert section and you just cannot afford to miss them more things you can look forward to carrot cake fruit pudding rum balls fresh fruit cake layered chocolate cake which had loads of layers of differentdifferent chocolates and they melt in your mouth thick raspberry yogurt and my all time favourite serredura you can splurge on indian desserts like milk cake pista pedas carrot halwa etc brbrthe winner of the whole brunch was the gudd ka rasgulla soft melt in mouth cottage cheese balls in silky smooth brown jaggery syrup well as they save the best for the last and chef made me taste this when i was done with trying out the desserts that i had on my plate this dessert hits you hard on your taste buds and mark my words youll fall for this particular dessert and will end up eating not one but two or may be more rasgullas a sure shot hit brbrby this time i was almost high on desserts and i had to skip a few more things which my heart wasnt ready to leave but i had tobrbrthe

love the food and place ambience was excellent as well staff was wellbehaved i would definately recommend this place its a must visit ❤️❤️ great place for sunday brunch with good music the ambiance was delightful and the staff ever so hospitable contrary to other opinions the taste is getting better all the appetisers were good but have quite a room for improvement for the main course and desserts too even though the ambience was lovely with live music and good service but the most important thing is foodbrand that was a major letdownbrdont get me wrong they had a large very assorted variety of food but when it comes to taste it was at best subparbrthere were not many options in veg main course and the rice was literally hard n crunchybrand the biggest let down were the desserts very beautiful to look so much so that i got every western dessert they had but they they were all a major let down very elaborate looking but in terms of flavour and taste i felt almost nauseatedbrso i would saybrambience 55brservice 55brhygeine 55brbut food 25 and thats me being generous food and service was amazing personally met chef mohan who prepared the dishes and explained the recipes to us took my parents for their 25th wedding anniversary had such a wonderful time thanks for your excellent service and kindness good food nice staff good service marriott a name itself says everything good ambience yummy food specially the dessert counter what they put for buffet simply loved it highly recommended went for a breakfast at this place bf spread was good nothing exceptional though there were many choices from continental south indian north indian western to typical malwa food for hot food section to choose from good variety of bread cheese freshly cut fruits met the expectations with plenty of drinks option to choose we settled for tea ambience was perfect and open kitchen was another plus for city like bhopal which was lacking good food options this place is a welcome addition to culinary scene enjoy your sunday brunch here very very poor service waiters dont listen cold stale food is servedalso many dishes were half cookeddont waste your money on this place tried its breakfast buffet in a well light and amply spaced sitting areabrspread in baked goods was elaborate consisting of wellfiled croissant 45 doughnut walnut bread tiramisubrcheese and

255 and grilled fish 355brbr much cry little woolbrthe food is not at all good the variety of items available is less the taste is not good as well much dissapointed given what they charge for the sunday brunch they have a good spread in their buffet breakfast and the waiters were also courteous and and paid great attention tk every table excellent service had an awesome bday party courtyard by marriott bhopal staff was polite and helpful food was utterly delicious we ordered momo salad which was so fresh and crunchy ♥️ loved the qhole experience very much ♥️ great desserts starters need improvement and variety service was outstanding i had forgotten my credit card they sent the guy right till the gate where i was to return it their restaurant is on the first floor so i was very greatful and impressed loved the opera cake and tiramisu buffet lunch for 3 of us was an utter disappointment tasteless food ugly menu selection senseless staff who was reminding repeatedly in a hurry to close down the buffet as early as possible momo cafe was a huge let\\u200b down buffet lunch was on 28th of april complete balance food i never eat before awesome food all over we are always came here to make our day special and we treated like special once due mr bhaskar in momo cafe resturant excellent service and humanity in mr bhaskar br i went to this palace for a treat by my senior brit offers a good variety of delicious food the ambience is good but there are limited options for vegetarians a good place for lunch one of the best places to eat in bhopal excellent ambience staff is very courteous and sensitive food is absolutely brilliant its a must visit for sure it’s awesome taste is not upto the mark food quality is horrible this place has a great ambience it has a buffet system where you pay per person where one may serve oneself on their own as the restaurant is quite in the heart of the city it is expensive but worth a try ambience of momos cafe is really nice snacks are sometimes coldthe salads are tastyand the buffet toothe desserts are superba perfect place for a decent lunch visited the momo cafe at courtyard marriott bhopalbrtriedbrwhite sauce

for service service was fast and the ambience is goodbrbr really nice experience amazing hospitality and service i found the one of best restaurants in bhopal chefs personally showed interest in taking my feedback not happy at all and very much disappointed with the food and service that too when you have guests with you i have visited several times for buffet but this was my first time for alacartebrsoup and starters took 40 mins to get ready mains took again 40 minutes and then order biryani which took 25 mins to add more desserts which are ready took 15 mins to come to table i was like how can something which is ready like biryani and desserts can take this much timebrto make it more worse got insect in my tandoori chicken starter though it was replaced later with freshly prepared starterbri was not at all willing to pay almost 15k for that starter but never mind now after dinner we sat for 20 mins to get wet wipes that pissed off my guests who went to washroom then to wash handsbri would like to mention that the staff was polite gentle and courteous but guess all went wrong on the day with thembrbottom line is not worth paying 10k for this experience and the night was ruined and being marriott bonvoy member never experienced this in past also as i visit frequently i would love to visit again to compensate this experience but lets see this is one of the standard starrated outlets and not a goto place for those on a small budget of course have big pockets fancy a star hotel don’t care how expensive can a batata vada get then momo cafe is your place i don’t find anything outstanding in their food everything is just ok and nothin to talk home about the ambience is great and it’s gud to hang around i have eaten almost everything on their menu veg and like i said it’s jus ok come here if you wanna hang out at a star place and show off and don’t really care about the food the food ain’t bad but the other star places in city and other marriotts across the country are doing a much better job of serving authentic flavours even the desserts are mediocre but look fabulous momocafe simply best value for money buffet in bhopal if u wanna eat unlimited with every variety this is a best place u r looking for for me in bhopal its the best buffet in terms of value and quality must try once food is served round the clock”br you can have lunch at 500 pm although choices available may be limited the buffet food spread is quite elaborate with lots of choices one can have sandwiches burgers chinese dishes in lunch the buffet breakfast is also quite lavish the staff is also very polite customer friendly and makes all efforts to make your dining a memorable experiencebrbut quite exepnsive all good sunday brunch is incomparable the quality and taste of food is very good great ambience and good staff visit here on a lazy sunday afternoon and you will want nothing more totally a bad experiencebrwhat could go wrong with a supposedly fine dine at marriott well almost everything brfirst of the ambience was very noisy thanks to the open kitchen then i got a bad recommendation for chilli chicken which was nothing interesting in any way fish chip was bad fish was over fried and chips were actually wedgeswith the skin on instead of fries top of that they were fried too brworst dish was margarita pizza which tasted nothing more than a domino’s pizza a thick base with heaps of cheese where was the tomato sauce and fresh basil bronce i gave my feedback to the manager he tried to save the sinking boat by saying ‘i told the chef to do good’ why does your chef needs to know what he has to do is that not his job anyways brbad bad badbra bloat in the name of supposedly fine dining great experience service was lacking could be much better otherwise the variety and taste was top quality yesterday went for a buffet dinner at momo cafeshakahari rasoi the food festivalitvws amazingly awesomedelicious tasty ample variety of food frm starters to desserts it ws amazing there was a separate chat counter and kulfi counter those were star attractions to the buffet hospitality is awesome i ws attended by mr bhaskar he is vry humble polite and always willing to help over all a nice supper good food service ambience love music very slow service of pizza pasta food cold and lacking taste excellent food and ambience food counters are not arranged properly both veg and non veg counters are together and this causes concern for veggies staff too is lazy and the overall service was not upto marriot mark the service of the waiters is not good good food nice ambience great hospitality brespecially mr ajay and mr brijendra i tried the buffet option costing rs1600 there are 46 starters including veg and non veg two soups and veg and non veg main course the high point is the desserts section it is simply awsum huge selection and variety five star rating for variety in desserts had buffet lunch rather disappointing buffetbrveg dishes were tastelessbrpaneer amateurbrdal spicybrother veg dishes averagebrhighlight probably were dessertsbrbrbut you wont pay a bomb just for desserts would youbrbrsetting okbrprice highbrbrtry other buffet options you wont regret went for food day before 31 jan 18 ordered chicken broth the only chicken soup in menu and a plate of shami cheese kebabs broth was chicken in hot water and kebabs though soft were bland and to top it all i got food poisoning as soon as i came home still at home recovering will think 200 times before going again kokila bhattacharyabrwent again on valentines day day before with my fingers crossed i hardly took anything and they had buffet murgh musallam was good as was singaporean fish and lehsun kheer was to die for skipped the cold starters charging extra

great places to have buffet meals in the townthe staff is courteous the ambience great and the live kitchen counter very good the spread is the best by far in the city with a good variety gave 10 discount so that we get buffet instead of a la cartebrremoved discount saying we are paying through zomato hence discount cannot be given yesterday i tried their navratri thali it was good the only think i did not like was lauki ki sabji otherwise all the items were good and one thali was sufficient for one person what i liked the most was puri and sabudana vada and one more thing which i kinda disliked was it took almost 30 min for preparing great spread awesome tate fast service unforgettable experience at the momo cafe always a pleasure to be here their sunday brunch is amazing a huge shout out to salina mam and dungar sir their hospitality was unmatched along with the impressive dessert layout and great flavours of delicious food a must come and must try especially sunday brunch where along with great food you get to hear the most melodious faraz ji desserts were very bad brthey were not sweet asian street food fest is onbrbrenjoyed the fabulous range of asian street delicacies from india thailand emirates and srilanka the massive and exquisitivity is really extreme and the vibrance is also very welcomingbrbrfrom my personoscope i found the food to be completely worth the price of the buffet on grounds of its varied divergence and vividity but on the stage of the taste except few diahes other ones has not touched the core of my heart as i found their taste to be very normal and not much wowy if this wowy feeling is put into them then this fest will be a complete masterpiece i look forward if this point is taken into noticebrbri highly recommend everyone to give this fest a sure try and share their experiencesbrbrthis fest is a complete bend to the usual food we get at momo cafes buffet dinnersbrbrthe most fascinating thing which i found is the stall

likingbrbrthis is all as of nowbrbrenjoybrbr i visited here when awadh food festival was going on and i had one of the worst eating experience since a long time apart from the prompt service and warm hospitality the most essential thing which is needed ie taste in food was lacking yes the ambience is good as should be when one pays more then needed for the food overall in bhopal there can be many a good places to enjoy dinner then this joint they really have a variety in dinner specially the desserts there buffet is a must try its moderately priced overall its exactly what a decent star rated restaurant should be like we occasionally visit momo cafe for their dinner buffetbrthe ambience is nice but its too open the open kitchen the the buffet area gives a very nice touch to the place the name however is a bit of a turn off because this is not a cafe at all the buffet is elaborate and pretty good though the standard of the menu is slightly inconsistentbrrate about 2300 with taxes for two people in the buffet without alcohol not a very good place for vegetariansbrhad a north indian lunch buffet worth rs 1000brsoup was okbrstarters were goodbrmain course was better than goodbrdesserts were not for vegetariansbrbrin all if u r a non vegetarian or at least eggitarian u should go to this placebrand if u r a vegetarian like me u ll be enjoying the ambiance and dal thats it plz avoid this place for lunch buffet yesterday just rushed for lunch here found nothing tasty or hygienic all food in veg preparation was stale parwal masala seems was cooked 2days prior no taste at all the buffet spread here has the finest variety of food especially the desserts yes ive a sweet tooth what i dnt like is that they do not need to provide puffs and savouries during lunch and they are not even that good great live melodious songs were there 👌👌👌👌 we had aglio olio and bolognese pasta and they were both 55 we complimented chef mohan for the pastas definitely recommend trying out both on my recent visit to bhopal to meet school friends this was the place we decided to meetup on asking about a place that was casual yet secluded this was suggested i would definitely say that it was secluded because we were the only people there but not the casual i had in mind but anyways the service and ambience were top class as you come to expect from marriot we had pasta arrabiata wildberry frappe and mojitos the pasta was very good with great flavour and texture the frappe was exceptional but the mojito was a bit too sour for my taste ultimately it was good value for money too unlike what we had expected overall a good experience it took them a great deal of time to prepare our food but as our visit conflicted with their buffet preparation time and their whole staff was occupied overall ill say it was a satisfactory experience for us the food tasted good portion size also was good and staff was friendly and helpful very good restaurant visited momo cafe thrice i like to visit it again again becoz of its ambience food obviously me and my husband went there for buffet lunch and dinner both are equally good with varied options especially the dessert corner its yummy awesome place i visited here for eating breakfast here with my boss and really breakfast is tasty and also after taking breakfast we did not need to do lunch hello guys if u r in bhopal u didnt try momo cafe yet then its time cause everything is special here there is no words for description this cafe having interesting offer like buy 1 get 1 food quality is awesome hostility of staff is impressive starter sweets spicy things r touchy food items r good fresh healthy chinese thai italian indian many other types of variable food fish chiken meat vegdessert sweet soupstarter everything is available under one roof i nearly went there 20 times every time i felt that why my tummy doesnt have more loading capacity if u r foodie u have to visit here good food ambience staff my all time favorite placethe breakfast buffet is sumptuousright from the parathasto the shakes to the bakery selectionits hard to find a fault with anythingone of the few places in bhopal where you would get both waffles and pancakesthe staff is also very courteouslunch buffets dessert selection is mouthwatering but my pick would be the breakfastkudos to the chefs food was awesome😗 services is too good ambiance very good amm super excited to visit again thankumomocafeforyourservices🍽🍝🍲🍲🤷\\u200d♀️😋😋😋 this place is suggested if you are looking for fine dine the dishes here are above average although they dont have much options green thai curry is highly recommended if you love thai food great ambience and interiors having stayed at marriott every month over the last couple of years have experienced their excellent hospitality every time every member of their team will go out of the way to make you comfortable and get you anything and everything as you please brthe breakfast spread at their restaurant is commendable in terms of variety as well as taste however every time i have tried ordering lunch or dinner from their menu it’s been a disappointment mostly whether it is the biryani risotto or indian tandoori pizzas and continental options have been a saving gracebrshout out for their amazing hospitality though having to stay at marriott while in bhopal means that you end up having atleast one meal in momo cafe brthe breakfast is the only meal that i gorge on here and so the spread is ok its more indian and less angrezi probably depending on the genre of guests coming herebrthe egg section is a cliched part with huge containers of egg batter and sunny side ups to order resemble a sunset because you dont get to see the yolks so almost every egg finally made is like an omelettebrbut none the less the food is good brthe cafe has a seating for about a 100 the staff is active and respond to your requests fast rajasthani buffet with live singer price reasonable for a high end hotelbr layout quite good but they could have done a better job with the furniture for guestsbr food quality reasonablebr overall experience just a tinge bit over avgbr very nice food and staffbrmr bipul served very well thank you taste was not good and very less options available it was not at all a 5star experience we went there to have a quiet evening with good quality food but the bar was right beside the restaurant and the music was playing real loud felt like we were in a low grade indian pub with loud music playing directly into our ears bron the top of this the service was very low quality we had to keep waiting for the waiter to come and take the order only to learn that we will have to go and inform the managers that we exist and are sitting at a centre table in his restaurant the food came pretty fast but the coffee that we ordered came after 1 hour yes 1 hour we had to keep requesting the waiter and managers if we were lucky to catch their attention to bring our coffee asap and they kept us in the wrong impression what a waste of time brnot even 1star restaurant experience when you walk into momo cafe the first impression you get is that it is a beautiful and classy fine dining restaurant the crowd is elite and the staff looks so well groomed that it just makes you slow down straighten your back and want to be as sophisticated as the surroundings but that is the end to what youll enjoy on your visit there the staff is slightly confused and hassled with extremely delayed service the food is just horrible i dont know who is cooking in there but they need a strong reminder of what good food tastes likebrthe thing i really appreciated was that the entire staff was very well behaved and even let the kids run upto the buffet and pile up their plates with dessert and we werent charged for it eitherbrbrwhat we ordered br1 french fries these tasted generic and like the deep frozen kind that just come out of the packet and into the fryer but no complaints therebr2 mushroom soup this looked like a bowl of gooey sludge it was thick and pasty and totally disgusting two spoonfuls and i was done havent ordered mushroom soup anywhere ever sincebr3 tomato soup was a good soup but not the best we have hadbr4 pesto pasta salad the leaves were a little bitter and the pesto did not have any salt in it tasted average and forgettablebr5 pasta arabiatta was simply weird the sauce tasted like a can of tomato puree with some salt and oregano not cooked or tempered in butter and 6 of us couldnt finish even one portionbr6 hakka noodles we loved it very well made and a delight to eatbr7 paneer tikka the paneer was delightful soft and well cooked and tasted perfectbr8 potato wedges never made it to the table and we never enquired after them eitherbrbrmain coursebr9 paneer butter masala was the worst paneer gravy i have ever eaten in my life the paneer pieces were good but the gravy tasted like tomato puree with a few mild spices and very uncookedbr10 handi chicken again it was pretty tasteless and had just a lot of chopped green chillies in the tasteless gravybr11 dal makhani thick and very bland with a load of butter nothing special br12 chicken dum biryani the dinner was starting to feel like a fiasco when the biryani came it was delightful and i was shocked they only served plain curd as an accompaniment and that was the only disappointing thing about the biryani it was lip smacking deliciousbr13 tandoori rotis and naan the breads were well made and served hot and the saving grace to those horrific curries brbrwhat made it worse was that they already have a very tight and limited menu and a few dishes we wanted to order were not available so it left us with very limited choicesbri wouldnt recommend the place if you truly enjoy eating good food if you are in the mood for amazing ambience and some quiet conversations then this is your place to go tobrbroverall experiencebrfood 310brambience 1010brprice 710brservice 710brcleanliness 1010 service is not good good place nice service variety of food is there to satisfy your taste buds and even after that if you dont like anything the staff is very humble and flexible to do modification as per your choice happily good place for dining visited momo cafe after long gap to pleasant surprise of good old courteous services at sunday brunch specially like to mention added entertainment of magic by ayush added pleasure factor besides good live music menu was good and preparations wonderful kudos to staff kanhaiya served us well and food was good momo cafe has been a favourite place to dine but yesterday’s experience was bad in terms of service we were not served starters on the table had to get them all from the counters food was good except for the pizza music being played was too loud for the dining area as it really difficult to even catch a conversation ambience of the restaurant is good it offers awesome desserts but main course is not that much good in short momo cafe is a good restaurant serving awesome desserts but main course is comparatively less tasty i have had amazing experience there food is amazing we spoke with chef and discussed our food with him best part is we can be seated out in all it was absolutely worth an experience hello everyone stayed for a day with courtyard and had food at momos cafe and to be frank service and food is awesome liked the chicken sausage and like the way of presentation and you should try it once breakfast or buffet its really good have tried their buffet dinner 34 times however never once have been satisfied with their appetizers and maincourse dishes the appetizers have alwsys been cold as if made a couple of hours ago you will keep on trying different maincourse dishes to finely find only a single dish which may satisfy your palatte that too if you are lucky the variety of desserts is impressive but the diversity is not much still better than the appetizers n maincourse overall not worth the price of the buffet for cold appetizers and one average maincourse also visited twice on their food festival during august both the times the food was dissatisfactory service by the live counter is also pathetic while i was traveling through mp we decide to visit marriott for good hearty dinner but got anything but that brbrwe attended the buffet at this restaurant that claimed to serve delicacies from across north indian chinese and continental cuisines brbrthe establishment is quite modern as are all of marriott hotels well lit spacious with ample personal space at the tables brbrthe buffet was quite an elaborate spread with items ranging from soups to salads to chaats and of course main course and a wide range of desserts despite the extensive options available there were very few items at the spread that one would go back for seconds to brbrthe few of such items for me were the manchow soup chaats from their chaat section chicken pulao hot chocolate pudding lemon bavarian for dessert brbrgiven the taste the prices seemed exorbitant the service was quite tardy with a huge lag that led to finished plates laying on the table with no space for fresh ones we just ended up shifting seats to make space as the restaurant was quite empty thankfully brbrwhat started out as a promising dinner experience turned out to be a rather dispiriting affair br the experience was excellent quality of food is very nice ambience nice very courteous staff as well the live kitchen is quite a concept food taste staff service both are awesome the best cafe in bhopal in terms of a good brand name lined up with great variety of snacks and drinks the place is good in terms of ambiance and decor i tried think crust pizza and it was goodbrbrambiance 810brfood 710brservice 410brbrpizza is good to taste but i would have paid more if it good be a charcoal oven thin crust pizza the hospitality and service is warm and excellent the ambience is great the food is okay not so good expected much better taste from marriott very disappointed with service staff and food taste could not visit a place just for its ambiance and friendly staff i am not sure will ever go to this place ever again best ambiance in bhopal can be seen in marriott the taste is wow starters are so yumm including the drinks mocktails and shakes are worth trying my favourite is blueberry punch and icetea although all other water based drinks are too good the butter chicken is the one i could die for the best i have tasted i didnt like the veg much but mutton curry and chicken curry is niceending with the deserts marriott serving huge yet mouthwatering desertsa set of all flavours you got in must try buffet once in mono cafe getting high quality food with reasonable rates in buffet good ambiance but an average buffet starters are average but main course is pathetic only dal is good worst part they do not serve chapatis brbrbreakfast buffet is good and worthy fresh stuffed parathas and choice of eggs with masala tea makes it perfect loads of choices i dont have to explain you about quality of food and ambience here its well known the place has formal or fine dine ambience which definitely makes me uncomfortable but the food is such soothing panaceabrbr so let me start with things you can specifically try out at buffetbrbrbreakfastbrbrparathas best parathas i have eaten were in punjab and next is this place they have number of stuffing options to gratify those cravings my favourite is paneer stuffedbrbrpancakes no words to explain that breuphoria and satisfaction when you have the first bite of your pancakes drizzled with honey my faourite is banana and chocochip pancakesbrbrlove omelettes do order cheese omelettebrbranother thing i loved about their breakfast is their vanilla shake and lots of lots of mushrooms boiled poached and blueberry danish pineapple struddle and carrot cake sweet tooth 😁brbrlunchbrbrstarters salads and desserts thats it main course was good but not extra ordinarybrbri loved amritsari fish chicken baguette and paneer tikka served definitely couldnt miss on hummus it was good but not the best there is this stir fry counter too you can ask them to serve it i came to know about it when i was full brbrif you like to have kadhai paneer somewhat spicy it can be disappointment its good but lacked that tangy spicy flavourbrbri better not say anything about non veg main course not interested anymore to have them at restaurants when you can get best at home brbrtheir desserts are great dont mis them i stuffed myself with three things fruit crumble cheese cake and baked yoghurt brbrplease avoid sago pudding it had very strong flavour of cinnamon if you love it then please i was disappointed to waste onebrbrthere are many other options one would love but i am gonna visit here for the selected things ambience is good service is best and all are polite but food is not up to marki expected better food from marriottcould be betterdesserts are also okay okaybrbr been there for lunch and really had an exciting timefood delicious and service top notchno room to complaint even oncechef and manager on floor to assit and staff look excited to serve with smiling facesi think momo cafe is the only place to have excellent time with familygreat job done by the team there went for a quiet family lunch on rakshabandhan day so not your usual workday lunchbrbrdisappointingthe starters soup carrot with a wide variety of rollsbread brinjal parmigiana were the highlights of the meal which isnt saying much for buffet for which you pay rs 1200 there is a pay for one one free offer on which is a pity as it compromises on the quality of the food brbrother highlights extremely average chinese i felt even a shaadi buffet might have done better taste wise no pasta or pizzas a wide variety of desserts most just marking their presencebrbrall in all one does expect better attention to detail as it is the marriott cut fruit had mosquitos sitting on them limp fries pannacotta tasting off ice cream had some crumbled cookies for topping boring and took 10 minutes to arrive from somewhere inside the hotel brbrcome on marriott you should be doing betterbr had been here for the mexican festival the good was delicious not so much variety as was expected was expecting more of mexican cuisine but they just had a small counter and the rest was just regular menu a little bit on the expensive side but worth it hope they have more such food festivals less options for vegetarians hence not recommend to vegetariansbrfood was good but price was little morebrice cream and pasta were amazingbrbr is it just me brsometimes when i take the first bite and even before the taste sense could hit the neurons on their way to my brain the realization kicks in that there is nothing better in the whole wide world than a mughlai indian gosht the food from the place had my bite from has surely arrived and arrived bigbrthis is what happened with my first bite of gosht rizala the other daybrthe lamb was perfect the gravy was perfect and the marrow oozing out was perfect i shamelessly asked for a complementary bowl of curd and they gladly served brbrthis was day onebrbri was lucky enough to get the chance of having a breakfast buffet and dinner buffet the next daythe breakfast had to be a lavish affair and it was couldnt get my hands on a lot of things to be honest was terribly occupied with office work so i literally had 24 bites of eachbrbrbreakfast no 1brupma which was delicious btw poha bircher muesli i never ever miss a chance to find one on a bountiful breakfast table anywhere sauted veggies with chicken sausage and corns and a little bread pakoda which again was fabulousbrbrdinner bra lot of people would say that not having a company can be tough sometimes eating alone just doesnt feel good but i over the years because of my travel i have had my shares of lonely experiences and somehow have found the right balance to enjoy them so dinner was one man one table thing againbrstarted off with the salads loved the tangy broccoli so much that i could have accidentally shortened their supply for the service jokes apart the salads gave my meal a perfect start with a bite each of the paneer chutney tikka chicken reshmi tikka and the fish starter paired the broccoli with kimchi to make it a killer combo in no timebrbrdid not have a lot in the mains to be honest but i should remember what all was therebrbrhummus baba ganoush mint curd greek saladbrdaal palak achari lamb gobhi masala spicy sabz baharbronion rice biryani brcurd and condiments to diy raita do it yourselvesbrthere was a continental side of food too which was predominantly fish and i dont remember what was it exactly brbrthe food had to be fantabulous but i felt that there was a bit of niggle with the hummus it felt very salty and very grainy casually asked the server if it was just me or was it really under prepared i forgot soon after and went back to my meal when chef saurabh came and to my utter surprise he admitted that the hummus was somehow lacking in a lot of things and was way too salty they removed the hummus part from the salad tablebrbrnow the desserts brsour cream cherry chantilly was the best of the best of the best captain brhave never ever tasted such a light cream pudding like dessert it was layered with flavours troubled to find the right combination of words right now to describe brwith the rest of them i could see all my theoretical knowledge coz of masterchef and chopped and coming to life the sugary tuile and crumbly pastry and panna cotta and caramel custard and mud cake pudding and then the indian part with baked gulab jamun and rose kheer perfectionbrbrbreakfast 2brnow this was a surprise walked in to be told that it was complimentary well how good is thatbrand like a true indian hearing free food i became hungry like jughead and sunk in well to enjoy one thing at a timebrthis is an account once again brstarted with my usual plate of fruits and a newer type of sprouts malka daal ie whole red lentils then a mixed parantha aalu gobhi pyaaz done lightly in desi ghee bregg whited typical indian omelette was next very well done nonrunnybrmy usual bircher muesli was replaced with strawberrry curd and blackberry curd for good bra handful of mixed nuts and a bite of cold pastry finished it upbrbrwow this review has become more like an account book of what i ate in the nutshell whatever and where ever i grabbed i bite from momo cafe everything was simply outstanding which to be honest was really expected toobrbra really humble thank you to the chefs and the servers and the staff who have been tirelessly doing their job day after day which includes going to great lengths listening to everyone and be there for everything soaking all the good words and then the really shitty ones with the same ear to ear smile this is pretty tough and that is why hospitality industry is considered to be the toughest one out therebrbrhope to get back asap staff is not trained the food was good but the service people are not aware of the zomato policies and are ready to create scene with the clients they are not customer centric at all good quality food and nice atmosphere to have when dining with friends or as couple nice touch of artwork can also be perceived great for quick bites slightly costlier than competitors but worth spending for a peaceful and beautiful ambiance food is equally good and one thing is sure that you will never be disappointed for taste we had buffet lunch here the ambiance and food arrangements are quite nice the staff was very helpful they brougth high chair for my 1 yr old son too food was tasty though choices of dessert for vegetarians were quite few its marriot n its buy one get one free buffet wat else one can ask for to have perfect lunchbrmain course salads and desserts are gud although dy r quite limited for soups n startersbrthe place has soothing ambience to it and v hve alwats been happie wid marriot hospitalitybrmr tanmay come bak to bayleaf v miss u there breakfast buffet is amazing and the spread has got very good variety the service interiors ambience and everything makes it a perfect place for breakfast the confectionery items are tempting and a must try marriot needs to take care of the food quality ingredient and hygiene visited momo cafe only because of such rave reviews and being a restaurant of an established chainbrit is a big let downbr1 the first thing it will appear at best as a food court in a 3 star hotel the food menu designed is just so wrong the choice leaves baffled with no proper balance between vegetarian and non vegetarian dishesbr2 the food ingredients are not upto mark the bread ordered with soup and pasta was stale the spring onions mature and with straw like texture noodles sticky so onbr3 food lacks taste no other word to say it bland is one thing tastlesness is otherbr4 absolute no sense of hygiene the staff both chefs and servers need a big check on it they will be cooking wiping off on their uniform touching ingredients bare hand so on and so forthbr5 servers are absent minded in terms of their table duty they dnt know proper crockery will forget spoon or put the cutlery on the table directly very slow in response and have no clue of service in hand asked them not to out corn due to allergy and 10 mins after the dish turns up with corn in itbr6 self service is a mess with spoons being mixed in cuisinebra sure shot dampener avoid at all cost had gone here during baisakhi festival the food was a disappointment being a punjabi myself i had great expectations also our waiter kept us waiting every time we asked for something by telling someone else to do it and he wouldnt do anything we should not be made to wait endlessly for simple things like waterspoon etc we were also served cold raan brextremely bad experience food quality and service need to be improved good food with clean atmosphere i have visited restaurants in other marriot hotels too and this was a level lower then that of big cities buffet served is not as good as it should have been but it is also not very expensive with such a brand name ala carte food is still better i will surely visit here again yummmmmmyyyy sooo sooo sooo expensive after alll it is 3⭐️ hotellll lovee spending timeee theree tastee is 😋😋😋😋😋😋 chocolate milkshake 😋😋😋😋😋😋 alfrado pastaaaaa😋😋😋😋 bad quality the gravy tasted like its burnt jala

of nai dilli restaurant but this is the first time i am ordering food from the restaurant via zomato taste of the food is good but service is poor first of they took a very long time to prepare the food because of that service is delayed and after delayed food some order is missed i ordered 2 missi roti but they have delivered only one i tried to call the restaurant multiple times but they are rejecting it again and again looks like they know that but dont want to accept that big restaurant like nai dilli have very good taste but they are not able to take care of their customers my over all experience is not so good they have very poor service suggestion to the restaurant is only this that they have to look for their service just an unhappy customer horrible restaurant too much price and no food also the quantity missing rubbish wont order from here again mushroom masala did not have any taste and dahi kabab had no curd something else was sent altogether the kukkad popcorn was not delivered sorry to write but recently the quality of mutton biryani has degraded the portion size is also reduced giving less ratings as they dont pay attention to the instructions kaise bhi karke banakar de diya gaya tha bahut jaldi mein aur theek se cook bhi nahin hua tha kisi aur ke liye order kiya tha food is good the grilled sandwich received in order is not in casroll and the veg sandwich includes only cucumber and tomato lots of paneer rotis were a disappointment bad bad very bad experience please dont buy from this restaurant i ordered chicken noodles received veg also i mentioned less spicy in cooking instructions however the food was extremely spicy brextremely disappointed totally wastage of money tasteless overspicy pieces is also not fresh overall it was so bad i had to throw it away fried chicken that too burnt isnt what you expect from chicken lollipop fish and paratha had too much salt taste and quality in this order was not as expected as earlier orders for same

worth it the quantity was less and there were no veggies and no taste great taste the ambience is amazing and the place is very cozy the staff is amazing and the service is very good brit’s a place worth its money brmust try the rotis were stale and not even hotit was too hard just okay too simple only fish no chips same as my test thanku the ambience is very very cozy the food is amazing and so is the service 🎁 its a must try excellent food sabji me baal tha sath me hi kankad bhi tha aur taste bhut hi khrab tha sorry but i want my rupees back first time toh bohot acha banaya tha chili paneer but aaj koi test nhi its like waste of money im never again order this cafe soggy jo order kiya tha vo bheja he nhi very bad restaurant don’t order again with this restaurant very unprofessional people taste was very good but the toppings was separated from the pizza very good item has been wasted packing is very bad good delicious biryani i loved it its finger licking good🤤🤤😍 too salty you have not send cutlery how will i eat it pathetic ignorance basic spaghetti aglio olio is extremely spicy inspite of giving instructions to not make it spicy they sprinkled extra chilli flakes on top of it it seems the instructions dont mean anything the bun part in the donot wasnt sweet and the frosting was compensating but the flavour could have been a lot better if the bun was sweet and the frosting had balanced sweetness excellent fresh salad only one bread and no spoon guacamole was not there portion of sour cream was less really fresh and tasted amazing pastry is totally stale the worst cheese cake i had in my lifeand the most worst thing is that zomato is showing 43 rating for this outlet not at all worth it give sugar with coffee if u r not putting any in it pathetic packaging this is how they delivered cheese cake i like their pasta totally worth it no salt in spaghetti added it separatelybrbrplz do provide oregano chillies flakes salt etc separately brbroverall taste was good after adding salt oregano chilli flakes to it very nice ambience and tasteful food it was delicious the pizza is soggy and very spicy they send me wrong product i ordered cake and they send me pastry the food was below average and pizza was tasteless do not try drinks and shakes cus that were pathetic very bad packaging pizza was burnt spaghetti was cold without a drop of cheese i have ordered 500 gm cake but it is very small good experience as usual pin and pan has become our go to place and we visit the place once every one or two months it has never disappointed me they have reduced the the portion size of hummus sundried tomatoes and olives the service should be improved dish choices are really limited the drinks beverages were horrible with too much sugar so much so that it was undrinkable pizza was good along with the crispy veggies good selection of desserts i like the food but packing is the worst half of my soup is spill in the bag i ordered a reloaded pizza it was good just the edge was thick making it difficult to eat rest it’s good the pizza and coffee were good brthe service was also prompt and friendly bit too spicy and lots of masala mast ek dum lotsa fancy stuff mentioned on menu but quality dint match up like sachertorte no feeling of apricot preserve in layers n quality of chocolate poor biscoff pastry also lost points coz of quality packaging very average pasty was fully shaken up by the time i received it the thinnest white box saved some costing but messed up reputation big time instead of reloader pizza they sent green pizza amazing food and courteous staff would highly recommend taste less food ambience was greatbrwe ordered 3 things out of which only the pizza being a chicken pizza it was a bit tasteless chocolate frappe was just water and sour cherry was not so sour both of them were way to sweet expectations were much higher due to ratings improve your packing bad food and the pizza is not consumable bought belgium chocolate cake for a birthday celebration and it tasted stale we assumed that maybe the icing is bad tried removing all the icing from top and from sides but the entire white frosting even in between the layers was stale the cake was not at all cheaply priced as well and we bought it as the food there was really good but the cake spoiled the much awaited birthday cake totally changed from earlier preparation and taste both roomali roti and chicken pieces were chewy this time although the gravy was too portion size can be increased little aman is good with service and well mannered despite requesting the restaurant not to give prawns in my order they delivered tandoori prawns i am allergic to prawns had to throw them away restaurant doesnt read notes and instructions we tried your food on our last visit to bhopal this time we planned to visit bhopal for your food only i ordered the tandoori shashlik mushrooms with 2 roomali rotis and dal makhani but the dal makhani is missing i’ve always loved their food and still do and i can only hope they don’t repeat this error in the future no doubt the food is good the chicken curry was delicious and so is the chicken tikka just like the biryani it could have been better we had a great time here i visited the place multiple times with my mom and we had a delightful time every damn time ❤️ mr shivam sharma was really warm

more expensive side but the quantity and quality justifies it we went there on sunday afternoon after preebooking a table which is recommended the food was awesome excellent variety place was jam packed and people were having to wait for half hour at least so pre booking is recommended the place is quiet small as compared with the people wanting to dine in and thats why a bit noisy but

pineapple and banana with some chaat powder i always order from here but this time thr chicken was burntwhole waste of money the portion size was quite less as compared to what comes when we dine inbrthe taste was also very different chicken chat should have more chicken cheese finger is not edible rice poor quality less salt poor marination of chicken this is for biryani we have eaten at the restaurant but as per today’s food it does not match with the level and taste of restaurant brchicken gharwala is having less salt loved it taste of butter chicken is sour in half portion not accepted same from ranjeet lakeview worst quality the taste was bad as it was too spicy and we were unable to eat and it smelled awful average it just didn’t tasted like a biryani didn’t have proper biryani

police complaint if the same thing happens again br2 ordered two soup got only one1 soup missing brbrsuch a big restaurant so poor service murg utter dakhin wasn’t good in taste butter naan was also not that great it felt like as if it was burnt overcooked but no doubt one of the best rumali roti i ever had in bhopal among all the restaurantsbrrumali roti was worth every penny spent on it i want refund i also like ur food quality and gaste the pasta is good but overpriced vahiyat itna jyada masala dal dia h k fruit ka test nhi aa rha sirf masale ka aa rha swadthird classrealy 😞 baked

disappointment never visiting again rotten brownie dal khichadi not god swad he nahi ha hospital sa bhi baker bekar mere order me glass tha portion size should be more at such price the box was already open when i recieved it i threw it right away smelly n poor masala n mutton sheek kabab should be packed seperatelyd sheek kabab became all soggy in d gravy chicken tikka had bone in it mutton seekh kebab masala was tasteless no flavour at all chicken hot sour soup was good i have been eating at ranjits lakeview since my childhood and have always loved the taste and consistency of the restaurant to deliver the same taste however this time my concern is not about taste but about safety and healthbrbrbrtoday while eating butter chicken i found a decorative studlike stone in my gravy if i hadnt noticed it while chewing it could have easily hurt or worse gone down into my stomach which is very dangerous for anyones healthbrbrbri kindly request the restaurant to conduct a thorough inspection of their kitchen and ensure food safety measures are followed strictlybrbrbrbefore posting this review i called the restaurant and informed them they asked for an image of the object which i am attaching here while i am still giving 4 stars for taste and quantity the safety issue is quite serious i sincerely hope no other foreign objects make their way into the food and im still in shock and in a hope that nothing entered my stomach while eating that gravybrbrbrbrplease make this a priority for the safety of your customersbrbrbrbrthank you and regardsbrbr there s a pet rat roaming in the restaurant and no one at the restaurant is bothered to catch it it is roaming on peoples sofas on their laps and when complained on top of the voices disgusting this was the best we ever had best quality food the taste was not at all good it was pathetic and the pieces of butter chicken were so hard not cooked properly disappointed very bad improve ur quality not satisfied with the quantity you charge so much after that also you dont deliver i ordered for some guests and now the quantity is so less i have to make other arrangements also please do proper packing its all coming out of the bag not satisfied specifically mentioned for extra green chutney same amount of chutney is given with both half tandoori and full tandoori should give chutney extra with full tandoori the standards of service as well as food has declined over past two years two out three dishes ordered were wrongly delivered preparation of chinese dishes is atrocious street food is better the ingredients used were stale the person who took the order packed up after taking order and the new waiter had little clue about the order there was hardly any rush in fact more than 50 of the restaurant was vacant it appeared that the staff was somehow waiting for their shift to get over brbrplease wake up horrible taste brstaff is very disrespectful brill mannered staff brtasteless food brnever ever gonna visit this restaurant again not good bengali toh kahi se bhi nahi thaa breads were overcooked and paneer was not fresh delicious as always if you want to have worst food in bhopal go there it’s not even passable food was good 👍 paneer was not fresh it was like rubber very bad and oily not at all a good biriyani if someone orders chicken soup then youre supposed to add the chicken into it dahi was apur missi roti was burnt not expected this from ranjit quantity was less and chicken pieces were small in size as compared to normal portion size they send pizza is very bad its nt proper cook i am very dissapointed t staff is not consumer friendlyrefused to take payment from zomato superb experience brsuperb food and taste the management is unclear about how the offer applies good quality and taste good quality needs to be improved we had a disappointing experience at romeo lane despite booking through an app that promised specific offers the restaurant refused to honor them leaving us feeling misled to make matters worse the service was poor with half the items on the menu unavailablebrbrwhen we asked to have the service charge removed—knowing it isn’t legally mandatory especially given the subpar service—the manager was dismissive and rude insisting we pay it anyway it was frustrating to be treated this way and to have no option but to pay extra for such a lackluster experience food isnt good enough not a good restaurant in terms of hospitality as the waiters are quite untrained and dont agree to basic requests made to them location is top notch one of the best bar and pub place located in bansal one ambiance is world class but price of all dishes is very very highbrprice of 1 roti is 99 brthis place only for rich people not recommended for middle classbrthey also charged 10 service charges and 5 gst extra brthey must need to work on his pricesbrservice is very good all staff is very well trained and friendly well decorated versatile gin options the curated cocktails are ok quality yet when competing with multiple clubs and cafes in the same building i guess the service could be more promt also more teaching on what is being served and how it complements a dish etc could be worked on over all good try long way to go in comparison to anything cyber city or commercial street i make the comparison with one thing in mind 10 service charge and same price of cocktail i want and deserve more cant be floored that omg bhopal at least has a bar that is not a standard to live by food is not worth as price and service is also not good never recommend any one worst i recently visited this place and it exceeded my expectations the food serving management was excellent with prompt service and high priority acknowledgment of orders the cocktails were also delightful and wellcrafted ambiance was also remarkable overall i would rate it 35 out of 5 considering the service ambiance and food i highly recommend it as a place to visit excellent food and review nob this place is meant for a good time but it did exactly the opposite ruined the evening staff is really rude they have strange absurd policies for entry even tho the restaurant is all empty on a weekday still you can’t choose your own table pathetic experience worst service ever everything is fine but when its come to service its worst experience ever u have to wait for your order more than 30 min not a recommended place if u r going with your frnds recently visited romeo lane and i was so mesmerised by the beautiful ambiance and great vibes the ambiance is so amazing and soothing along with that the food here is really good and delicious i absolutely loved the presentation and taste of the food items i tried i would recommend to tryout their shroom sabmbar and dragon roll whiche were so good and delicious also the aromatic goblet cocktail all my heart so you can try that too very rude staff and manager they are only there to make bills we being customer were requesting and they were behaving like a cheap bars i had come from very long distance after one of my frnds recommendation but now i will never recommend or suggest this weird place

quick service amazing ambiance and food was delicious good in all extremely disappointing experiencebrbrratingbr service 15br quality 05brbri recently dined at rubarru in bhopal and unfortunately my experience was nothing short of disappointing the service throughout was abysmal with orders consistently delayed and delivered late despite multiple attempts to communicate with the attendants even after requesting expedited service there was no improvement in the pace of servicebrbrto add to the frustration the bill took an excessively long time to arrive with six iterations needed due to errors whats more the inconsistency in service charges on the bill fluctuating without explanation was deeply concerning and left us feeling deceivedbrbradditionally there was a complete lack of courtesy from the staff including the managerowner onsite their indifference towards our concerns only exacerbated our disappointmentbrbroverall my experience at rubarru was extremely unsatisfactory and i cannot in good conscience recommend it to anyone seeking a pleasant dining experience in bhopalbr must recommend very close to mp nagar and everything was good garlic bread was on the dry side

we had to argue for 20 mins untill someone from the restaurant figured it out it killed the whole experience brin all go at your own risk there are really lovely places in bhopal to dine so this one

thajale huye kulche the quality is not good supreme quality improper packaging we have been visiting this place from the time it has been open but one thing which needs serious improvement is their service we wait for 1015 minutes in between starters to mains to finger bowl and bill brthere is another serious problem that shouting in the kitchen disturbs you at this restaurant we never experienced this during lunch but during dinner it’s always complaining we have asked the manager to keep the guy shouting at kitchen to be quietbrcoming to food for which we went the 3 stars are only because of their good and hygenic food brpanner hyderabadi is a spicy main course dish which is must try also corn salt and pepper that is crispy corn is also good for starters brbr visited this place for a lunchi must say snacks were really toothsome ambience was very decent and the staff there is very polite specially anchal tiwari they took my feedback for every dish and service ws fastbrwant to

looking to be yourself in a simple surroundingbrthe experience the valet is greatly organised with ample of waiting space the best was that i didnt hear a single horn and it preserved the sanity of the pleasant eveningbrthe staff and service this is the most critical and best part about this place right from the welcome desk to finding a table and then serving food was great just a small word of advice please train your staff a little more to be able to advice food i dont mean they didnt but perhaps couldnt be confident on their suggestions 😊brbrthe food after everything its all about good food 😊 and the food we had was actually good to taste and nicely preparedbrthey served it with the right quantity of enthusiasm and condiments too so it was a great food dinner brbroverall this place

except the reviews constructively i am here in bhopal on an office trip since yesterday checked in to sayaji hotel yesterday i had two options to have dinner one in sanchi and the other in a bar b q both restaurants in the same hotel and i decided to go to sanchi during business trips i prefer to have lighter food and ofcourse tasty stuff i was advised by the restaurant manager to go for khichidi i reluctantly agreed to his proposal brbri was in for a surprise along with hot hot khichidi i was given curd papad and salad i was more than satisfied with the services quantity taste and of course price brbrhey guys when u r on a business trip here you can try out this option sanchi bhopal vs indorebrthe ambience was okbut the food was amazingordered chinese for starters some italian to warm up and indian to conclude brbroccoli based pastalight sweet with little essence of coconut something novel goodbrin indian the nargisi kofta again light served with rich sweet tomato spinach base and kaju methi malai also was very neat and perfect overall amazing experiencebrwill go back for more food was fine but service was very unsatisfactory 1 the non veg lunch buffet comes to just 610 including taxesbr2 food tastes great especially the dessertsbr3 service is excellent and the chef made it a point to inquire about the taste after every round of servingsbrthis place lives up to its reputation of being a fine dining restaurant the lunch buffet is available on friday saturday and sunday would recommend it to everyone july 16th sunday 1400 hoursbrbrwent to the sayaji for the first time as a celebration for my 3rd rank parents were proud i guess and generous of of course so we went ahead for lunch at their fine dining indian restaurant sanchibrbrthe restaurant was spacious with an attached corner bar and about 70 covers divided into 2 sections the restaurant had a very sooting ambiance with yellow lights and charcoal black walls the cutlery was a deep green and mud colouredbrbrstaff wore white shirts and black pants and had a little knowledge about the menu the server who tended to us had a bad odour from him as well the menu provided to us had a missing page of thr indian breads and when we wanted another menu the served started narrating the breads it was a little awkward i noticed there were no napkins at the table and the fork i had wasnt proper and also there was no cruet set on the table now considering that they tag themselves as fine dining these basic things were done wrong service here needs to be improved big timebrbrthe menu was very confusing some starters on the 1st page some on the 8th they were printed on a laminated plastic which felt cheap contrary to their food pricesbrbrcoming to the food we had shabnam ke moti veg kolhapuri dal tadka and bread basket the food was excellent after being subjected to a very bad service the food amazed me everything was freshly prepared had a striking flavor with correct balance of spices and delicious food talked about itself in my mouth great taste please click on the food pictures to know more about the foodbrbrthe place is pricey service lacks its charm but the food is delicious wouldnt recommend for a lavish evening but for its food if you want to have a peaceful dine in experience sanchi is the place for it after having a great experience at kebabsvilla the restaurant was able to met the expectations sanchi deserves 4 star coz kebabsvilla deserves 5😄brservice 355brfood 45brambiance 355 i had heard great reviews of the place but was highly disappointed when i visited the ambience and service quality were poor and food was averagebrwhen we entered the restaurant there was no manager valet at the entrance to guide us to the table and once we took a table they came to tell us that it was reserved though there was no tag that read reserved on the tablebrthe cutlery kept on the table looked old and unclean i had to ask the waiter to change it which he did reluctantlybrthere were 2 napkins on the table of 4 persons on being asked for napkins the waiter got just one and we had to ask for the second one which i think was stupidbrwe ordered paneer laziz murg pashtun laccha paratha and butter naan the food was average however the laccha paratha was exceptionally hard to eat totally not recommendedbrthe food took long to come and i had to remind the waiter to get the meal when he was merrily strolling in the restaurant brall in all would not recommend the restaurant for anyone who wants to enjoy good food and good time with family sayaji indore is much better than the one in bhopal however the ambiance is pleasant yet perfect for dining starting from non veg platter i like it the most including main course the mughlai chicken is yummdal makhani is must for me i didnt like the taste of nonveg curry much instead first time i enjoyed vegetarian cuisine had really a worst experience because of long waiting time first to get inside restaurant and then getting food itself is a task you have to literally remind them that you are a guest too they perfectly ruined my mom’s birthday dinner taste is ok but service is pathetic great food good service ambience is above average lasagna is a must try food is below average non veg platter was decent but egg curry was horrible very oily and tasteless when we asked the staff to look into the issue with egg curry their response was less than satisfactory which brings me to another point their staff was distracted and wasnt trained well they served one of us with finger bowl while we were eating and later they served us the finger bowl with cold water long story short find another place for yourself and save yourself some money and time i have been to kebabsville like 3 times first time i wanted to try the ala carte restaurant so went here food was amazing as always ambiance and service no doubt is excellent everything feels so perfect staff is well mannered and polite and they come and ask you about the taste of food how satisfied you are with taste its really nicebr good to have such a nice restaurant in bhopal the food was amazingggg service price way of presenting food was upto mark totally worthy and satisfactory vigirn mojito and chicken noodles are a must try in bhopal this is the best of the lot excels in ambience the its got the superb service the food here is to die for both veg non veg i am looking forward to go there agsin v soon as sayaji is known by its name we expected it to be grant and imagine it would be a great expirence but as we went there we are really disappointed with the kind of ala carte menu and bar menu we got plus the service can be a bit better the food is ok ok though the drinks are really good and really happy for that well to start with the ambience it was excellentthe service was pretty much good besides the waiters were quite friendlyi tried veg manchow soup which was perfect going to the appetisers we had bhatti murgh a medium spicy fresh chicken tempered with desi ghee was just wow moving on to the maincourse we had nargisi kofta served in 2 gravies red and green and biryani which was also good lastly for the dessert we had chocolate roll which basically a brownie dipped in maida and deep fried was ok nice ambience value for money supporting staff very good quality food except the look was not upto expectations of sayaji the variety in menu is limited poor place worst service by the staff altogether not a place to spoil your evening last sunday i was here at sanchia closed restaurant in sayaji hotel newly opened in bhopal for dinner with friends in the starters we ordered veg kebab platterbig and pasta it contains variety of kebabs enough for 6 persons pasta gave the true essence of italian food in the main course we ordered sweet and sour vegetables with crispy noodles and cantonese rice which i didnt like much there are variety of other dishes in both veg and non veg section but i have found more variety in sayaji indore it is because it has newly opened here in bhopal being sunday there is so much crowd and some are even waiting for the table service provided is appreciable and i suggest you must go and eat there ambience is ok they have limited menu for veg its an average place to go in terms of food ambience and pricing however they have lots of variety in non veg pathetic slow service the staff was very slow in catering to our requests multiple reminders had to be given ac was not working where we were seated we had to call the manager to fix the cooling issue extended time to bring starters and drinks the server was clearly disoriented and had no knowledge of how to serve customers they were not swift and lacked experiencebrbrthey took 20 minutes to get the cake to the table and all of our guests kept waitingbrbroverall pathetic service and inattentive staff they were slower than a tortoise hopeless experience at sayaji sanchi bhopal for dinnerbrbravoid avoid

inside sair sapata was not as per expectations we found sayaji nearby and visited the placebrits a beautiful resort with pool side restaurant but that was only buffet we chose to sit in a la carte restaurant but sitting was inside due to ind vs pak it was totally emptybrwonderful ambiance polite and well mannered staff brwe ordered cream of mushroom soup and egg hakka noodles waiter brought cream of mushroom soup with butter cubes and some breads quantity was also good the preparation of soup was bit different and tasted really nicebrthen came the noodles decent in quantity but i would say it was good as per the restaurant generally such big restaurants have poor quantity noodles were delicious and we both loved itbri would say worth visiting this restaurant good place to eat in bhopal with wonderful ambiance first thing that hits you about the place is location and the wow factor of the ambiance it’s beautiful made and then you enter washroom and everything that was looking good turns into a disaster it’s was in pathetic state so smelly it was a nightmare just to be there in a 5 star category hotelbrwhen we had food there were no complaints it was fresh and taste was

doubt very good and staff is very friendly and the variety of cuisine and dishes are very wide totally love the place ❤️ i would have given minus rating if there was an option sanchi restaurant by sayaji was a go to place for our family but this time the experience has been so awful that we are never returning the staff is rude incompetent and pathetic on asking the special in the menu the response of the floor manager mr diwakar was that everything is normal and things on the menu are only available for service the main course had a very pungent smell and the kofta had gone bad cant describe anything more disgusting than this and they were charging for the food that was not consumed from the main course ordered mr diwakar a pathetic staff member who is responsible for nuisance of this sort and the chef was so arrogant that he could not show the basic courtesy of coming out and saying something about what needs to be done will never ever come back to sanchi so dissappointed with everything here the managers and owners should look after the property or else staff like diwakar ji will soon cause a major setback food 45 staff 45 ambience 45 hygiene 45brbrtry out sanchi restaurant if you havent food is amazing though a little heavy on pockets ambience is good staff is warm and polite this was my second experience here at sanchi and i was amazed to see such perfect balance of all aspects of a restaurant ambiance is fine service is best in class and food is great toobrdo give a shot to paneer houssaini tikka its awesome completely unsatisfying experience we celebrated a birthday here at around 930 in the night the variety of soups noshes and main course items was so less that we didnt feel like placing an order in the first place we were 15 people among which maximum were nonvegetarians the bites took a lot of time to reach us it was almost 11 when we started the bland main course the quantity served in relation to the price was average the food did not taste great at all we had to get 23 items changed twice or thrice the nonveg meal had all bones and gravy in it the entrée was somewhat better the dishes took a lot of time to appear and were served intermittently however the staff was really courteous and customer oriented they heeded all our calls though the response time was a bit long 3 stars only for the courtesy and politeness of staff 10th september 17brmy family and i went to celebrate my sisters birthday since we had booked a table they reserved a very nice and secluded area for us i am biased towards sayaji having spent 4

courseahh few optionsi didnt like there any paneer dishes at alli mean this place is ruining the image of sayaji indoreprice for food was 499 taxesbut still no taste and few optionsthts nt sayajiplz improvebr i used to go to this place when it was called greenwoods country club its green and open environment made me ask my parents to revisit it again and againbrbut now things are little different the sanchi restaurant offers you great food but the ambiance is so gloomy that you start to wonder if you are in a dimly lighted warehouse brthey also do not have provision for outdoor dining during lunch and thus you miss half the fun the area designated for kebabsville is fantastic but opens up in the later hours this is heaven for food lovers they serve excellent and delicious food that will make your heart melt the prawn and fish tikka are a delight to have the place is awesome the food here is so delicious to put into words these days lucknowi food festival is going in there the cuisines in that list are really great you must visit once till the fest is on above all the staff here and their service adds on to this overwhelming ambiance of this place the best in bhopal staff hospitality is very nice i think the food quality and portion size is good too nargisi kofta is a bomb ❤️ added this place on my priority list for perfect fine dinebrelegant ambiencebrstandard

taste but it was very delicious these guys are living up to your expectations when it comes to non vegbrstaff was gentle and politebrservice was promptbri ll definitely go for this place againbrwhen are you guys trying i will tell you how there was an insect floating on the mocktail i ordered but before that let me tell you how the same dinner turned out to be the most satisfying one in this era of fine dining tradition sanchi is a place which never fails to disappoint you sayaji after all these years remains fiercely beloved amongst diners the bhopal franchise lives upto the tradition located on van vihar road the surroundings are calm green and lonelyat night i must admit i was a little unnerved by the place at night but once you enter the gates everything seems good brbrthe restaurant has a vivid setting with one intense golden shade of light dominanting the area the hall is divided into two sections one with the bar and one away from it decorated with masterpieces and wooden furniture it gives you a feel of a contemporary fine dining restaurant moreover the amazing glasses used to serve water and the crockery adds to it the music is just perfect and so is the ambiencebrbrbeing a decorated hotel the service is prompt staff is courteous and polite though on my third visit i experienced some lack of attentiveness from the staff this time there was an insect in my mocktail which they changed without any questions this shows how particular about the taste and quality of food there is a particular policy of the hotel which i appreciate they dont take tips in short the hotel staff has been quite welcoming towards the guests a few glitches here and there are acceptablebrbrthe food menu is a blend of comprehensive indian cuisine along with some variety of chinese and continental the beverages menu is an elaborate affair with an interesting range of spirits and mocktails though most of the hard drinks are subject to availability spice girl was the mocktail i ordered it was predominantly a khus flavored drink with a refreshing taste and signal green colour the first course of my meal consisted of scrumptious indian starter platter with fish tikka chicken tikka sheekh kebab and prawns the kebabs were succulent and delicious whereas crispy konjee lamb was burnt and shish kebab wasnt up to the mark coming to the main course the bread basket was an interested package of assorted indian breads murg e agan prawn curry and murg pashtun are my personal recommendations the meat was properly cooked and fresh gravy was rich and satisfying overall the food will always make me visit this place especially the indian dishes the price card is well in accordance with the quality of food and ambiencebrbrto conclude i had a pleasant dining experience with food of the most exquisite flavours for this reason and a comforting drive i highly recommend going to sanchi for a family dinnerbrbr another best by sayaji love their nonveg platter and thats a regular always would like to see something new in their menu but the best thing is that its so authentic and food is rich in flavour that you order anything it is upto its worth have had lots of family dinners and have been satisfied completely br wanting to celebrate the new years eve with family the sanchi restaurant of the sayaji hotels didnt disappoint me at all the tables were decorated with rose petals and the aroma of the place was pleasant we were greeted warmly by the staff and didnt have to wait for the table as we had reached there at 800 pm peanuts were served as complimentary snacks as is customary for the sanchi restaurant they had a different menu maybe because they were expecting a big crowd to turn on on the big eve the menu had limited choices of veg as well as non veg food we had ordered the dahi kebabs which were simply delicious and had the burst of flavors of paneer and dry fruits the dal karari was for sure the one that stood apart as well paneer hyderabadi was just decent however they can improve a lot on the breads they serve the breads didnt remain soft after 1015 minutes and were not outstanding either a must try place in bhopal go for the ambience the food served and the joy of being served with utmost warmth the ambience is very cosy before your order you will be served with lots of delicious snacks 😊 try garlic naan without butter its garlic fragrance is mouth tempting brthe perfect dine experience in in the city of lakes been here couple of weeks backservice and ambiance were okbut food was not up to the marknot at taste i was expecting from sayajiand highly over priced for the quality of food they are serving they take really long to bring your food theyll make you wait for the table around 40 mins although the restaurant is empty most of the time the staff is really not that cooperative the food was good however i wanted to try lasagna which wasnt available they said due to lack of ingredientsbrconclusion is you can skip this one not worth what you pay for it is a renowned place of fine dining in bhopal so people come here with a lot of expectations but the staff here is uncooperative we waited for one hour for a table for 8 people and suddenly some bunch of people came and sat on the table arranged for us and when we complained about it the staff didnt respond nicely it just annoyed the atmosphere of the evening entirely so we had to leave as it was already 1040 pm and restaurant closes by 11brnot a good experience overall taste 55brambiance 45brvalue for money 45brbrthis place doesnt need any

even the after sale service is one to be mentioned proper feedback is taken is if you encounter any problem it is checked and corrected at the same time i would have given minus rating if there was an option sanchi restaurant by sayaji was a go to place for our family but this time the experience has been so awful that we are never returning the staff is rude incompetent and pathetic on asking the

tastebuds say that this food is best from the rest you will feel it at sayaji for sure 😍 just embrace your tastebuds and move forward 😉 br i went for lunch buffet on a sunday afternoon with my family we had to wait for almost an hour for the table as the place was too crowded when finally we got the place and moved to the food section to get the salad and starters there were no plates the starters came on our table after waiting for a while the service is not at all good they kept us waiting for every starter and we had to request them to get the starters every time really disappointed with their service and the ambience it was the first time we went their for a lunch buffet as normally we go to kebabsville for the buffet we won’t be going ever for their lunch buffet the starters they served were cold and stale visited this place for a family dinner and wasnt disappointed a bitbrthe ambience is decent nothing too fancybrthe service is prompt and staff is quite friendly and enthusiastic about taking a feedbackbrwe ordered a couple of mocktails and then the main course which consisted of fish gravy yummy and two veg dishes brthere was some mistake and they made both veg dishes out of paneer they were good but similar when we pointed out they were quick to apologize and serve us the originally ordered dish and didnt charge for the wrongly served dishbrall in all it was a good experience and i would like to visit again booked for a 16 pax buffet lunch on 24 marextremely sad experiencebrwelcome drink served selectively and not to all despite repeated remindersbrbrsnacks quality and refill atrociousbrbrmain course pathetic in terms of spread and tastebrbrservice from staff and attitude of line executives and managers displayed is not acceptable from reputed hotelsbrbrabsolute zero value for moneybrbrwe used to visit min once a monthbrserious reconsideration for future utilisation of restaurant services there is always a waiting period involved however for all the hype the servings are essentially mediocre on more than one occasion they have mixed up our order owing to the rush the buffet alternative on the same property is a much better alternative first of all this joke of a restaurant is roping people in by saying that they are kebabsville and consequently theyre taking reservations by saying that theyre kebabsville they cant even make reservations on their own laurels my family and i had the worst experience in this substandard restaurant the food was served cold the waiting staff had no idea about what items are available in the menu and theyd take 5 minutes to tell us that the item weve ordered is not available and this happened with 3 orders incompetence of the highest orderbrplease do not go to this restaurant where they charge such high prices for coldly served food with amateurish servicing and management sanchi by sayaji at bhopal doesnt appeal much i had a lunch buffet and hence kebabsville couldnt be my optionbrbrto be honest it doesnt feel like sayaji at all second quality of food and spread of buffet isnt great v limited options seating and ambience just average unlike sayaji indore and if i do it at par with other hotels in bhopal jehenuma and marriott steal the showbrbrcoming to food not a great variety atleast sanchi wont be a next visit kebabsville bhopal might bebrbrfor the buffet price 450 plus taxes it is acceptable enough but u wouldnt mind a better spread at lil more price since agenda with buffet is food only the ambience of the place is good enough food is ordinarily good though quite overpriced especially the appetizers recommended for a grand celebration but not repetitive dining fine dining luxury restaurant is exactly how anyone would define this placebrthey have taken the words atithi devo bhava very very seriously and anyone who visits will truly feel pampered like a kingbrthe interiors are minimalistic and classy and you immediately get very comfortable in the environment there is no crappy loud music playing in the backdrop or too much chaos from their staffs end this place is a very smooth sailing ship and someday i would love to meet its captainbrthe menu is extensive covers a few different cuisines and has some very interesting dishes on it their drinks menu is equally good and i always tend to order the bartenders surprise drink because it is always a new but perfect drink to trybrwe have gone through the menu in the numerous visits and there have been very few things that we disliked and only because it did not match our taste buds we have also on countless occasions requested for dishes that are not on the menu anymore and the new chef has been more than courteous by catering to our special requestsbrthey had the most amazing tomato and basil soup also a delightful and hearty bowl of spicy noodle broth which are no more on their menuheartbroken also the best aglioolio spaghetti which is again off their menubut every time we request for it we have been served this dishbrbrthe thing to note and kudos to the management for this is that they take care of and pay attention to every little single tiny minuscule detail the water glasses are always filled before they get empty they serve only mineral water and do not charge you for it the dinnerware and silverware are always placed and replaced without you having to ask for it they serve a fully loaded bread basket with their soups and never accept a tip on the bill because it includes a service chargewe were once followed all the way to the reception to have our exact change returned by a waiterbrbrwhat i would recommendbr1 the crispy sweet corn this is their signature dish and nobody gets their crispy corn perfect the way they dobr2 tandoori chicken tastes perfect and the quality of the chicken always feels much more superior to other restaurantsbr3 the aglioolio spaghetti if you can talk the chef into prepping this dish for you then you are in for a delightful surprisebr4 the dal khichdi wholesome and pleasantly surprising definitely not home style and worth a try when you arent in the mood for oily over the top spicy foodbr5 the

once amazing food if you have a sweet tooth deserts are just awesome the property is good though some areas are not well maintained a lot of variety of food is a available the only issue is that to use an american express card you have to go all the way to the reception firni is amazing went across to try the punjabi food festival at the shahnama as is the case always the welcome the greeting the service was just super and personalized a must try for punjabi food loversmore importantly the entire sequence of service starting with starters to desserts was just seamlessbrbrthe food and the

best place in bhopal as far as formal eating out is considered i agree that restaurants like bay leaf are there but shahnama is simply the best be it the veg cuisine or the non veg the mutton here is just awesome best place for non veg lovers everything was nice from food to walls a must visit place in bhopal though food was a little bit costly but it worths every penny royal ambience nice food plenty of tasty veg dishes to havebrbefore order check your wallet pbrbrgoforit royal worth brbrregardsbrsameer singhai a heritage hotel serving you the best of mughlai buffet shahnama has a royal touch to its ambience decor service and food the buffet isnt exorbitant on the contrary it is worth every single penny there would be variety of starters and soups of fish chicken mutton and vegetables which would gently lead you to their main coursebrthe main course is as appetizing as the starters and has another set of variety to tease your tongue and fill you bellybrthe array of deserts that shahnama would provide will leave you spellbound and in a daze of choicesbrthe place is a must visit for a food lover in bhopal you can never go unsatisfied with this place it has the best buffet in town and have the perfect selection of food set up a great fan of the live music which is so soothing while you enjoy your meal basically a fan of everything shahnama the last of the bhopal chapter being the grandestbrvisited shahnama at jehannuma palace hosting the biggest and the best buffet of the townbrdont ask the what all i haddont actually remember the names of so many itemsthe place offered mughlaicontinental and chinese cuisines in the buffetthere were an array of dishes extremely well cooked waiting to be devoured☺the best part was the desserts for us so many options will definitely blow your mindbrthe five property will definitely leave you amazedbrcostrs1400 tax for both veg and non veg buffetsbrbrbhopaldiaries bhopals one of the best hotel ever i had vistedpleasant environment was there food was good outstanding variant and along with several recipes i would suggest everyone to visit there and spend some quality of time with your loved onesthough i didnt take any pictures to upload beacause i hate sharing photos of food on internet the palace is one of the oldest palace now converted to an hotel the food herewith very good with an malwan taste i took kabab here in the central hall restaurant the kabab are very tasty the way it cooked and served in the table was just amazingthe chutney preparation was in their own style very lavishing and very good nutriousvery good to see this hotel in the rainy season to see the beautiful garden and the hot tasty food awesome ambience and awesome taste specially fish i love fish which served in buffet here i think buffet of jehan numa is best including sayaji and touch wood but yes here main course is also tasty as comparison to sayaji great place great service delicious food and mindblowing ambience with live music and live tandoor shahnama is a multicuisine restaurant in which two types of services ala carte and buffet in my recommendation i would suggest you to take buffet its worthy and closefisted and it can be satisfactory excellent buffet everything was very tasty i loved the mock tail and mutton saag specially lots of options for salads and deserts and main course starters were very good but choices were very few always skeptical about multicuisine restaurants shahnama has always been a pleasant surprise probably because the hotels base kitchens both indian and european are so good that local aristocratic families and not just tourists come there for meals is a great testimony for the place try it in the afternoons for lunch or even for breakfast and you would not regret it stick to the indian mughlai or hyderabadi fare would be my suggestionthe best haleem i have ever had outside of hyderabad the polite and highly helpful staff makes for all the more pleasant dining experience nice experience for a first time stay at the palacethe ambience and layout is just perfect and has a vintage touch to the decorthe breakfast had a spread which obviously was not as elebrate as a 5 star should bebut was decent enoughadding a pic of my plate only wow i had breakfast there and what a spread they have amazing service and courteous staff on top of it some dishes were really awesome masala omelette was like very soft and tasty then had freshly made juices watermelon and mix fruit then in yogurt they had some honey mix yogurt which was like great they also had a vide spread of fresh cut fruits and nuts overall a very nice experience here shahnama is the best restaurant among the starred hotel restaurants it serves buffet for breakfast lunch dinner the food is very delicious with lots of variety right from starters including street food to main course to desserts for vegetarians you will be surprised to see dishes beyond daal and paneer in north indian main course i have been to this place lot many times and every time found the food better and better the ambience is awesome with live music during the dinner time the hospitality is also good with chefs insisting you to try their newdifferent dishes again again and the main chef would come personally on your table to ensure if you liked the food and would take your feedback in case you have any complaints my experience with their services was very much disappointing i mean you dont expect such poor and slow staff from an a rated hotel like this they really need to work in this area also the staff is not very polite the food was pretty decent but the overall experience was bad because of the service majorly breakfast marks the beginning of the day what way to start with a royal treatment wide variety of optionsbrambience 👍👍brfood 👌brservices 💐💐broverall a nice placebr the shahnama restaurant at jehan numa palace a royal heritage hotel in bhopal is known for its food the grandeur and the ambience the breakfast buffet is superb value for money at just rs500 per person with options ranging from paranthas south indian breads and cheese eggs bacon etc the breakfast buffet is a must eat here similar are the lunch and dinner buffets except the fact that they are more expensive than the breakfast buffet but then so is the variety in these buffets non veg biryani is to die for and

display from vegetarian to non vegetarian from paneer to chicken from mutton to fish from egg to fruits the starters side of the menu had it all there were different kebabs and all of them tasted delicious the main course was also spectacular a wide range of dishes were present a dish called firfosa was the dish of the day for me shredded pieces of fried mutton it was yumm the desserts menu was also vast a variety of pastries and mousse and ice creams were available a preparation of lasoon ki kheer was also made not a huge fan of garlic though but an appropriate cherry on the top of a lavishing meal nonetheless brbroverall one of the best restaurants in bhopal the service was one of the best i have seen and would definitely visit again well to tok about ambience its old and on dull side but that what is known as heritage the live music was on average side as we were not into it but thefoood the food totally mesmerosed us and we enjoyed every bit of it once the orchestra was closed doen for the night do try their malai brocolli and methi palak kofta once upon a time there is a jeha numa palace hotel known for quality food and stay but now those days are over i still hope they will wake up after this review i am jeha numa customer now found that they downgraded quality and taste no value for money you need to came out from the coocoon or shells you are wearing your

food withbrnice service and the peoples there 💐 should visit once to make your opinion and we are sure you will like this💐 the food was very delicious brbrbrservicing a buffet in todays age is piece

with full dedicationbrbrfrom soups to the starter to the main course and then desserts every item on the counter is delicious packing all sorts of flavour smoky palak raita then five spice lamb in the

course is the weakest link of the whole experience but shahnama has kept the quality of its main course at par asserting its qualitybrbroverall if you planning for an easy night with friends and family who call themselves foodies this should be your first choice of preference although they need to work on their french desserts or if not possible just get rid of it from the dessert section as they already have plenty of best options in serving shahnama restaurant of most prestigious heritage hotels jehan numa palace in bhopal serves you with the best buffet in townbrbrambiance quite cosy comfortable relaxed to enjoy your each bitebrbrmenu it’s lavish elaborated substantial which serves you with a great variety of both veg non veg delicacies including soups salad bar snacks station lunch wagon chinese italian indian mughlai last but not the least the hearty dessert shelf brbrreasonably priced giving you the full value for moneybrcomplete treat for your eyes taste buds visited this place some time back with my workplace colleagues have to say this is a palace indeed the best non veg food in town ambiance is good and so is the overall experience when we visited it was the punjabi food festival going on and so the food was set accordingly the buffet had plenty of variety and was good to tastebrthe best part however were the dessertsbrthis place is a must for anyone celebrating anything or otherwise ok so let me start with the entrance which was ethnic now the ambiance was ok only nothing much special except for the music n songs on demand to start with the food v first ordered mocktail dranquil litchi and goodies kiwi which were yummy then the veg sizzler which was yukk not at all tasty having boiled brinjal i mean bolied brinjal sersly coming over to mains v ordered chicken rogan josh and prawns schezwan sauce along with gobi paneer bhurji paneer butter masala veg chinese manchurian and triple schezwan noodles sauce tossed of all tastiest were the prawnss then rogan josh and chinese take my advice and never go for the veg sizzler there cant forget the slowest service v found there overall the final verdict that high priced and less tasty foods not worth the money my experience was ok wil think twice to visit shahnama again great royal ambiance with live music best for nonvegetarian service was excellent the staff was very friendly and kind there was option of buffet dinner as well as a la carte quite dissatisfied and disappointed came here to have dinner with family for birthday celebrationbrbrpros br good servicebr mutton curry was quite nice and spicybr baked yogurt was lovelybrbrcons br tasteless starters no spice no crunch only oilbr baked fish was just as tasteless as their panna cottabr much too overpriced shahnama can easily be called among the best places in bhopal for non vegetarian food kebabs biryanis and fish are all time favourite i specially like the mutton biryani and amritsari fishonce i went for the ongoing food festival but the experience was not very good coming to restaurant its nicely decorated with lively ambience service is efficient though the waiters lack the finnese of a star hotel prices are on a higher side and the quantity is decent visit this place to enjoy non veg food best food in the town along with luxury dining ambience is superb highly recommended went with family for dinner only issue is a little bit pricey pros the buffet its variety the ambience background music live counters all you can eatbrcons not at all a college student friendly place not worth the money for light eaters the food is somewhat not upto the mark disappointed in deserts same price for veg and non vegbrverdict this place is definitely a must go once for it is the place in bhopal but i suggest better choices are available just came back from the bengali food festival at jehanuma hotel pretty authentic fare including shorshe illish and all varieties of bhajas hilsa in mustard curry lamb curry fish head biryani mutton biryani deviled egg were all true to the original taste patishapta for dessert highly recommended skip the jaljeera thoughbrvisited on 1318 for lunch as always starters were mind boggling main dishes were good and mushroom goulash was to die for dessert had many sugar free items which i gave a miss ate caramel custard and amazing beetroot pudding shahnama never disappoints nice and rich ambiance a nice place to have dinner with family its lavish and so the rates specially for the buffe but fair enough to visit once in a while starters and dessert is good main course not so impressivebroverall a not so budget friendly restaurant but good if you want to experience the royalty this is an old palace which by the way is very beautiful and lavish brabout food delicious mouthwatering and nutritious food clean and hygienic good servicingbr shahnama as the name suggests definitely gives you a shaahi royal treatment this is a part of jehan numa palace hotel which serves you a grand stretch of buffet all year round breakfast buffet lunch buffet and dinner buffetbri chose to go for a lunch buffet today as soon as we entered the place must say the staff is highly courteous they make you feel welcomed warm and extremely comfortable hospitality is what honestly makes jehan numa stand out from all the other hotels in this citybrambience is royal and again very different from that of others their buffet stretch was huge from soups to various kinds of bread a cheese platter salads deviled eggs dahi badas veg and non veg kebabs veg and non veg tikkas chinese and thai section of gravies and noodles baked counter pasta counter two kinds of rice veg and non veg gravy vegetables types of naans and rotis and a dessert counterbrpresentation is really good it tempts you to eatbrwell i tried eating the maximum dishes so that i could give a proper reviewbrhot sour soup was actually brilliant why did i say so its because mostly when served hot and sour the soup is way too hot the black pepper used is way too much and gives ones throat a bad time rather here one could taste the hotness of the soup with the sweetness of the veggies and gave peace to ones throat moving on to the salad counter had watermelon and feta which was brilliant corn salad which was accompanied with green bell peppers and lemon juice tomato and red chilly powder and did taste good homegrown lettuce salad and this is one of the best juiciest fresh lettuce i have had roasted chicken salad which was scrumptious to the core the chicken pieces were roasted to perfection with little spices and brilliant moving to the main course their dal fry was finger licking good with perfect amount of tadka tomato rice was average nothing different or special about it paneer laziz had soft and tender pieces of paneer cooked in tomato cream and cashew gravy which was extremely rich in taste kele ki subzi was something unique which generally people fear cooking is because if not cooked well the combination of spices and bananas give an extremely bad taste it wasnt bad quite bland and highly plain in taste still couldnt make me love this vegetable and add on to my favorite list junglee maas was something i had for the first time and was quite spicy so people who love spicy foodit should be your pick babycorn cigars were dipped in batter and deep fried and gave sweet and sour taste all together and was one of the good starters mushroom stronganoff was something which took my heart creamy and rich in taste the mushrooms were covered in thick creamy red gravy chicken lehsuni tikka was good but not something i havent tasted before it did taste quite common chicken methi tikka was extremely tasty the best i have had till date the chicken pieces were marinated well in spices and methi leaves and they were juicy and tender enough to melt in your mouth simply loved itbrone should have a developed tastetaste buds for fishes and various kinds of cheese i tried the hunan fish and smoked cheese for the first time the fish even after being cooked had a very strong smell the smoked cheese had a pungent taste and gave a hint of bitterness as soon as you swallow it so go for these two only if you wish to build your taste buds or already have developed onesbrlets move on and satiate our sweet toothbrchocolate mousse soft perfect melting and brilliantbrbrownie filled with dates nuts and a base of crumbs was one of the bestbrcookie dough pastry dressed with chocolate and baked with chocolate chips was again tastybrbaked curd baked curd had a little sour taste with brsweetness of fruits something different and nicebrmoong dal halwa it was nicebrcaramel custard well they never go wrong with itbrby the way the lunch buffet is rs 899 16 taxes on weekdays and rs 999 16 taxes on weekendsbrits totally worth it had dinner yesterday breakfast here today the restaurant seems to hold the best restaurant tag in bhopal brit can accommodate about 6070 people and the interiors are goodbrthe restaurant serves up delectable chicken and mutton dishes true to the nawabi taste their dal tadka is very tasty the ruhai baingan is a masala loaded super tasty dry curry the chicken butter masala is a thick gravy style item which is also tastybrshahnamas food overall is very good they serve alcohol and the restaurant is hotel jehanumas flagship eatery brmust visit good place in bhopal food the food is delicious and the quality is excellent the buffet is very good and it offers good variety of snacks salads maincourse desserts the service is excellent the ambience is simple but pretty the sitting is elegant and comfortable went with friends for chinese lunch food was freshly prepared delicious and great drinks too the service was fast seating is comfortable overall good experience our favourite go to place and hands down the best place in bhopal if you plan to go drinking the menu is exciting and offers dishes one wouldn’t imagine in a city like bhopal courteous staff great decor and ammmmmazing food along with a great decor what else does one need went to shahnama with lot of hopes however the entire experience was just above average on a relative scale brambience 910 overlooking the lawns of jehan numa the restaurant is shinning bright with natural daylight there was a group of semiclassical singers which just made the overall atmosphere lively shahnama gets a thumbs up for a family friendly relaxing ambiencebrservice 610 service gets a low score on relative scale for shahnama generally from a restaurant of this repute you expect a personalised and smiling service however thats not the case with shahnama servers were just courteous enough to take your order there was some bit of confusion also with respect to table numbers and nobody bothered to serve food into our plates well not expected from shahnama still theres nothing so negative about service its just that shahnama wasnt up to rather high expectations on this frontbrfood 910 we decided to go for a la carte and straightaway ordered paneer pasanda and punjabi channa with stuffed naan and curd the paneer was so rich with dry fruits and flavourful thick gravy it was sufficient for two of us and we really enjoyed our meal similarly the chole were well cooked with delightful aroma the naan was also well cooked and was good piping hot so the food totally overshadowed the not so good service experience and earns the points for shahnamabrprice approx 2000rs for two including taxes this is for a la carte limited lunch had a chance to experience the murshidabad food fest at shahnamabrbrthe staff were really courteous and helpful the food prepared by chef sarita sarkar was fresh and authentic to tastebrbrthe highlight for me was the gondoraj lime juice and the sukhto bengali style mix vegbrbrthank you for bringing a part of my culture to me wide breakfast spread new varieties added daily the dinner spread is elaborate too in a la

their and service it has become consistently worse with time wish management take better steps to improve upon the service grade and hospitality yesterday read about punjabi food festival going at shahnama with dishes by masterchef sweety singh i must say it was a grand buffet welcome drinks till desserts it all had the punjabi touch lassi sugarcane juice starters were awesome salads were all desi flavor they prepared some varieties of pickles n special chole over all it was a treat to taste buds a must go place visited this place many a times the wonderful memories i used to have at this place is now totally gonebrbrshahnama used to serve wonderful variety of salads indian mughal continental etc this whole scrumptious variety has totally gone as they stopped serving it the way they previously used tobrbrsecondly the taste has also gone hell down and they also serve you leftover dishes of previous buffet which i caught them while having the devilled eggs salad chicken noodle salad which was so dry and stinky when i pushed them to serve me fresh the difference was drastically visiblebrbrin short if someone really want to ruin their special day this is the perfect place for itbrbrfinal say apne pet pe kulhadi maarni hai to zaroor jaayebrbr♡peace♡ the buffet here is good but its expensivebrthe ambience here is different compared to othersbrthe place and vibe here is

quality has gone down and prices have gone up brthe dinner setup is decent brbrbetter than average service and nice ambiance brbroverall just an average experience but considering other options in the city its kind of the best i guess my favourite favourite favourite buffet place of all i have had buffet meals in hell lot of hotels be it taj raddison hilton lalit mariott you can name any but this place beats them all each time we have buffet meal in any part of the country we end up believing more strongly that shahnama is best of them all so much variety and fab taste desserts and salads are beyond awesome ambience is simply beautiful i so love this place and the food here bramazing presentation makes ur mouth water😋brstaff is very well mannered and the serving time is very quickbrdesert section here drools me bra must visit for the foodie ppl the 4 star is a rating given mainly because of the desi chicken korma which was ordered and devoured with some naans loved the korma which was well braised creamy with a lovely balance of spices infused the rest was food as usual not an exceptional variety kind i would suggest to stick to bhopali specialities when visiting this place walked in for dinner with a friend on a chilly winter evening herewhat followed was nothing short of an experience of a lifetimehogging on delicious kebabs mouthwatering mughlai for 4550 minutes nonstop accompanied by pindrop silence does explain the impact the food leaves on u the warmth and desire to attend to each every guest does make the hospitality department purely worldclass dont forget the shammi kebabs yesthe succulent chicken cooked in kali mirchthe post dinner walk in the premises with a pleasant nip in the air wrapped up in pashmina does make this place a mustvisit if you are in the city of lakes yesterday on 10 of may 2015 i went with my family for buffet dinner in this restaurant with my preconceived notion of going to a great place it was a great disappointment it was ill kept service was very poor cuisine was limited food was looking stale buffet at most places was empty and it was a complete disaster please discourage others because you may spoil your evening delicious food good hospitality brvariety of food it was pleasure being here hygienic and clean we had been to bhopal for 10 days this is the one of the best restaurants we visited the ambience was good it had a wide variety of dishes to choose from and the taste was also good but what disappointed me was the service provided i placed an order which took them around 30 minutes to bring it that too was not complete then it took another 20 minutes for them to complete my order overall the experience was not so good found this piece of glass in butter naan left the food paid the bill and came back after letting them know they took the piece and said it was a piece of coal ambience 45 food 45 staff 55 hygiene 55brbri loved this place the ambience is elegant and grand its so simple yet so pretty the seatings are so elegant and comfortable live music is great food is tantalizingly good they provide the option of buffet and ala carte i opted for ala carte and had vegetable kothe masaleydaar choley dal shahnama and roomali roti everything was better than i expected quantity of food did justice to the price its a little heavy on pockets staff is great they are polite well trained and courteous i had a great evening at shahnama would highly recommend to visit this place was staying in jehan numa palace hotel for my brothers wedding and got a chance to have breakfast n lunch buffets at shahnama the breakfast buffet was elaborate and the items on the menu were well thought of however it did not leave me spellbound so the breakfast buffet gets a 45 brcoming to their lunch buffet it was truly impressive with some mouthwatering food they had so much variety whatever you can think of was there in the buffet be it the main course salad starters soup dessert it was arranged perfectly and tasted amazing so this certainly deserves a 55 ambience wise the place makes you feels warm and comfortable overall a fine dining experience this truly north indian eatery is part of the large addition to the old palace i first stayed in thirty years ago when i maintained an offie in arera colony this was the only hideaway in a crowded city the city has transformed and so has the hotel

achari murgh yummy ambience 95brfood 100brservice 100brvalue for money 95breverything is good about this heritage hotel shahnama is buffet style restaurant with lots of varieties live music is the added attractionbrrecommended fish fry shawarma baked breads and deserts when we ate at shahnama a year ago the food was average we were disappointed pleasantly surprised to see that the food has vastly improved now had the dinner buffet with friends and family earlier this week brbrgreat salad counter imaginatively presented loved the shot glasses with achaari moolibrbrone of the nice things about the buffet is that the chinesethai station was not just an also ran but provides a good alternative to the indian counter with starters and main courses much appreciatedbrbrchef at live rotinaan station turned out a very good aloo kulcha on requestbrbrdessert counter had great choices baked yogurt and papita halwa standing outbrbrthe restaurant was soon packed by 9 pm so good idea to reserve a table just one suggestion might be a good idea to lay out cutlery dessert and other spoons at a couple of places so we didnt have to keep asking and waiting for the busy staff to give us fresh onesbrbrmy rating is the best buffet in town just now a tad expensive at rs 1200 per head including taxes but your go to place for a celebration definitelybrbrthe challenge would be to keep this up

west food gandiye kharabh khana khila rahe h its not veg kothe its chinese super dry boiled mix vegbrlike really kothe is a dish thats prepared in an indo chinese way not stir fried potato with cauliflower with schezwan my suggestion would be to fry the vegetables in flavoured batter for the crunch that this didnt have and sauce for deep flavour unlike this very thin layer of flavour dont order from here worldless experience worst food good taste in his biryani and also packaging is good good taste 😄 tasty the taste was very good and ambiance was also awesome ✨ poor quality taste is

point pathetic food bill not providing with food keep progress suruchi delays a lot but their food is really good chole bhature was tasty and gulabjamun was very soft and yummy taste of bhaji was

moreover the taste is worst i will never order again from here and i don’t know how with such poor service they can get a 4 star ranking wrong order delivered the juice too much sweet and taste like chemical solutions i ordered the juice for taking my medicine but now im irritated with the all things roti quality not good hamen aapki service bilkul pasand nahin i 👎👎 the pineapple juice was not

the taste was awesome and the rotis are very soft hope to get the same taste and quality again when i order i have ordered cold coffee but sugar is not added in cold coffee cheese is not there worst pizza nice food roti and puri is so good but in the bhaji so much oil worst food ever never order from the freaking frod resturant verybad experience 😡😡😡😡 dont gooo for this it was very tasty but the i gave 4 stars because it had a less amount of salt but although it was tasty and i will recommend every one to try this out waahiyaad swad taste was awesome and specially i like that special side dish just lyk mustard sauce but very very different sauce finally very special taste on this side dish thanks to serve us taste is not good and maybe oil is used instead of butter in bhaji portion size was good salad chutney and pickle was also provided in extras but overall taste is not that great a new nexus has evolved and due to this regime no no body is questioning unemployment the mobile of the delivery partner are being exchanged and people are decentralising there duty to another i ordered lemon rice and got something else which was not feeling completely cooked also instead of poori bhaji i have got paav bhaaji please use more mozzarella cheese instead of liquid cheese 😓 if you eat at this joint you will feel so homely that you will feel like coming again and again ask any item all are mouth watering a home away from home must visit paneer is good i really like the taste just one suggestion increase the quantity specially gravy paneer pieces are fine lovely food at night thanks too much food colour also butter paneer is suppose to be sweet not spicy order matar paneer but received butter paneer they do not curd and yellow chatni which is complimentary with sabudana khichdi rajma is not so good but the rice and the bhaji is awesome but if puri is freshly baked it might be a great meal thank you for the meal we ordered bread kulcha and the order was accepted but after 20 min of order when it was almost time to deliver they called us to tell us they didnt have it and then we switched our order from bread kulcha to laacha paratha also the paratha was costing 50 so for 1 paratha they reduced 20rs but this ruined my experience why to take order if you cant fulfill lassi is not sweet delivery boy behaviour is to good 😊😊😊👍👍👍 one off the worst

forgot to deliver pepsi exquisite taste impeccable quality and thoughtful packaging a culinary triumph irresistible flavors the quality was outstanding and the packaging ensured everything arrived fresh this is my go to place every time i visit bhopal love the ambience and service the gentry is pretty good here brdo visit this place for a peaceful meeting and some drinks drinks are the same as anywhere but obviously very highly priced but the japanese food here is definitely something for which you must visit this place teriyaki sushiaah heaven this place brit will be always close to my heart every ups and downs of my years at nit has a moment here food is amazing and the draught beer is pretty decent anybody visiting this place is suggested to have kebabs and cocktails ambience is close to an english bar plus the staff if very friendly hail this place listen it taste the same at ranjeets lake view that too at a lower price no value of money after being renovatebr as it is situated in the famous jehen numa palace the service and the staff should be amazing but to my surprise it was a really bad service they do offer 25 percent off on alcohol as happy hours but the staff has really less knowledge about the menu the place has good ambience and the quality of food is good but they only lack in service attitude i had been to this place several times and had great experience with them i am extremely impressed with their liquor varieties terrible terrible terrible placebrwent to tao on a sunday night thinking any restaurantbar in jehanuma palace must be good brand boy was i wrong the food is terrible and extremely over priced the quantity they serve is just enough for 1 person the only think worse than the food is the service we had ordered a sangaria pitcher and after have it a few sips it was pretty evident that it’s more juice than wine when i pointed this out to the waiter he argued with us insisting that the sangria was perfect brthe food was absolutely tasteless local thela makes better noodles and dim sums brwouldnt recommend this place to anyone you’re better off staying home than going here zomato asks you to be polite in review but how can you polite after visiting such a hot n happening place right in the lap of bhopalbrvery beautiful attractive place u will feel so kingly in this palace good to place to be with frnz had a brief but a gud tym food was gud drinks with innovative presentations a feel gud factor for mebrrecommendedbr1star lessa gud music could be a cherry on the topbrbon appétit 😊 coming here since my college days and every time i visit here old memories come back to me it was what we used to say luxury in those old days its like a home where all the old staff is still there since last decade and their professionalism is no less then any world class restaurant or bar will visit soon and have my whisky best place in bhopal to have a relaxing drink very nice staff very nice food all it lacks is a great lake view but you cannot have every thing so basically this is the place where all the heavy on pocket people start their alcohol journey brfabulous ambiance crazy drinks and superb staff is all that defines this placebrhappy hours are always rushy and drought beer is the best thing that would happen to here although they have least food options available but then who wants food a great place to hang out for a sport match cozy sitting on a hot day with drinks is all i need d its a lovely place to go for chinese food the ambience of this place is unique and something you wont find anywhere else in bhopal after renovation with good interior this place is gastro bar ambience of jn has always been good but if we talk of gb it has not impressed in terms of service food earlier they served quite delicious number of snacks which had variety now they have come up with so called less options and that too some exotic preparations which unfortunately dont taste good on the top of it as complimentary snacks wafers so pathetic to expect from jahanuma they have hiked the prices too much with a weird trick as mentioned by lot of regular visitors of jn though number of brands of liquor served has increased music is good but sounds system needs improvisation jn has always been on my prior choices and it carries a legacy in bhopal it will be fine if thats carried further its a very nice place with a great enthusiastic atmosphere beverage are served in traditional recipe if you are going to alcoholic beverages draught beer is best and in snacks cheese chilli cigars and tortilla chicken are delicious i would recommend you to taste that and there is a dj night in every saturday if you are crazy about crowd and edm then that night is for you only believe me service is not as expected brhalf of the drinks are not available brcmmon u just have kingfisher to serve people come here for pitcher and management is not ready to serve even when it is availablebrpathetic jehanuma the only place in bhopal so far where the combination of good ambience good food good music good crowd can be found food is limited to quite a few which i would suggest could increase in variety drinks have been rated at abit higher side but is ok due to its location more advertising and opening nights can be started to draw more crowd and attention if you want to compete with your counterparts from other states with so much scope for improvement would love to visit it again great staff amazing drinks and amazed to see awesome food its a beautiful bar with great seating but they dont allow clicking pictures or else would have definitely posted the interiors loved the fish fingers here with scotch awesome service too glad to see such bars and lounges in bhopal decent place with a nice ambience one of the best places in town to get draught beer combined with happy hours which include 2 complimentary snacks the deal is very easy on the pocket brsingle pitcher serves about 5mugs brbrbest part no creepy people extremely calm poised and cosy place i found the taste of the food average tho menu doesnt have a lot of variety the vibes are vintage classic and impressive because of the palace service and staff was excellent parking facility available very easily the cheese of alfredo pasta that i had was chewy and yummy and it was baked perfectly but i found the overall taste very vapid menu didnt mention which pasta theyll use i prefer penne and bhopali restaurant mostly serve penne only by default but they served macroni french fries herbed potato skin were great and with long island iced tea and cosmopolitan martini turning up perfectly for me my day was sorted you can give a visit for sure but mind the taste preference visited this place after a very long time this weekend and was in for a disapointing surprise many common brands of alcohole were not there and forced to drink balantine and it was nothing in comparison with red label and waitters were very rude as asked them about taking our drinks to smoking area he took our glasses and started shoutingin short bhopal now has many other options now and you should explore them rather then this place which has not upgraded there service as they did their menu chilled out place with good cuisines a place you could spend your saturday evening or sunday afternoonbrratingsbrfood 405brbeverages 305brservice 305brtime taken to serve food can be excused but for draught youd never need 15 mins improve that beautiful interiors good music and an attentive staff food though very highly priced was delicious this was my first visit and was impressed by the place what put me off was the complementary chips they serve with drinks why chips why not plain roasted peanuts or something else healthy and because they are so addictive i ended up having loads and feeling sick pathetic experience they asked us to pay the bill after every order and the staff is very rudebrthey charge you for extra drinks and don’t even own up to their behaviour and mismanagement perfect food perfect ambiance good service and downright the most amazing drought beer in the city a bit pricey though ofcours but its worth horrible place highly over priced they charged us 2500 for a party entry with only 5 people in the partybrbrthe only girl in the party was with me😂😂brfeel so bad for this😑 ansolutely horrible management downright insultingbrwhen you come here in a large group they’ll overbill and refuse to own up to it still decided to come here a second time with guests and the behaviour has been outright unacceptable what amazing hospitality 👏👏👏 does not worth it plain and simple they had best ambiance in town after modification it sucks you stripped all your best services and become a big sucker brit had buy1 get 1 offer i was fan of is gonebrthey used to offer complimentary snacks now just bad testing chips only brimproper placement of vents and speakers probably the best bar in bhopal in terms of service food ambienceand they serve the best mocktails in the towntalking about the food i love their thin crust chicken and cheese pizza and bouquet of fries and the nachos with cheese were the it comes with three kind of dips which were amazing definitely 5 stars from my side the interior is really amazing staff is good service is on time you must try pitcher there if you are beerholic i have been here three time and rate it as the best gastro bar in bhopal the area and name of this place says for itself it is obviously a gem of bhopal’s food platter and serves upto it’s name and expectationsbrthe food the ambiance the crowd the booz you name it and everything is awesome horrible experience bad lighting the staff is not forthcoming visited by very shady people oh and no selfies allowed in the bar its all hype and no substance remove ravi as a manager absolutely patheticbrhated the vibe and atmosphere here would not recommend it to anyonebrbrbr i have been a regular to this place but had a really disappointing experience recently we ordered a chicken burger and found a piece of the plastic toothpick which was used for the presentation we wanted the order to be cancelled but the management didnt pay here to our demands which is really pathetic given it is a heritage hotel we are dining in poor managementbralso we ordered potato wedges and it was shocking they served the frozen mccain ones and not fresh ones this is highly disappointing from such a renowned and reputed place in the citybr some of my visits were great some were worsebroverall nothing can be said bout this placebrtheres no consistencybrabout food its better than okayish but the issue is bout pricingbreven if you buy a 300₹ dish your 500₹ coupon is gonna get consumed theres no fairness in the dealbrhospitality service depends on what day what time are you coming here ie nothing but the crowdbrthey dont know how to manage crowd at allbrbrbron the basis of some good worse experiencesbrfood 810brambiance 810brhospitality serviceoverall exp 210brworth 410brbrtheyre just earning on the basis of the brand name nowbrbr arguably one of the best pubs in bhopal to grab a few drinks and surprisingly it usually isnt crowded brbrthey serve woodpecker draught beer which is a great tasting beer btw the place is well lit service is prompt and they serve complimentary cheeselings what else could one wish for d a nice place 2 chill out vt old buddiesit is economic when visited in happy hrs especially the pitchersbrconsbru cannot smoke wit a beer hence hav 2 move out but tat keep indoor air cleanbr i was expecting the food quality to be great but sadly it wasn’t while one may not notice such details when drunk a sober person will definitely notice the fish and chips were bland absolutely no salt what so ever the fries apart from being bland were over fried and i could literally taste the oil which shouldn’t be the case the chicken lollipops were tiny why the only redeeming quality was the server who was very polite and welcoming which needless to mention is his job boasting to be one of the finest in bhopal one should better get their act together because everything was really disappointing this time one of the top 5 checkpoints i have been strongly suggesting everyone visiting my hometown for quite sometime now i might be biased because of the memories i have of tattenham with my folks when i assert that this place with its typically oxfordish woodwork and naturally lit ambience during the day topped with the beast of freshly brewed beerslocal but you cant have better isnt a thing you want to miss while in bhopal amazing place been there a lot of times nice ambience great service and humble staff good to go place for a fine evening with friends and family br wow heaven for the liquor lovers before taking a seat here double check with the manager brbri’m a regular at the place and at all hehan numa eateries restaurants and spas i took a table after asking one of the waiters whom i always tip very generously if the place is available despite saying yes they ask you to get up from there in 5 mins i mean what is this it’s embarrassing to go to a place like thisbrbryou do this in europe they’ll treat you like you have zero ethics or respect for people and will make sure everyone knows something like this happened not cool and not going here again maybe you can do better without their crappy and culturally bankrupt sense of service good ambience and service but the food was too sweet for my liking pad thai and crispy lotus specifically brbr ambience is obviously so goodmusic is mild nachos need to be improvised as cheese got hard in just 5 minutesdrinks are goodwhat i liked is 25 percent discount in happy hours this is the bar that makes you think you are in london after a few pegs its the drinking lounge where you should take your chinese clients to impress upon them how anglo you are and that we drink better beer than they guzzle in shanghai its the place in the afternoon to sit with your laptop open to impress and attract some parisian femme fatale how hard working and computer literate you are and then theres the crispy finger chips the place was good ambiancefood and drinks is so lovely the staff was really polite and carefullybrfood is of high quality and yummy food i love this place

this is one of the best place to hangout with friends i never miss to be here whenever i visit bhopal nachos are amazing and those chip which we get with draught br 👌😍💙 this is the only place in town where you get to have a mild draught beer woodpecker i loved the classy look of the bar theres a smoking zone outside which gives you a beautiful natural view if you are seeking joy with your drink royal style this is the place to be tremendous place with variety of beverages specially the staff service and beer is far better than others this is the heart of jehan numa palace bhopal excellent food menu is extensive and different from the other similar places around it can be bit expensive but worth it highly recommended a perfect ambience to spend evenings i prefer to order non vegetarian food here with drinks one can enjoy time with good food drinks and music brbrservice is good and staff is cooperative brbrits crowded during weekends but little vacant during week one of the best places in bhopal to grab a beer they serve woodpecker beer which is a mild tasting beer with a bit of citrusy flavour i wish they increase the range of beers it is great place the food served their is excellent the nonveg platter is very good the ambience and service is also excellent it enjoys the perk of being in jehan numa palace without any doubt one of the beat place to have good drinksbrfood menu of this corner is limited as compared to liquor menu though draught beer served here is what makes me visit this place again and againbrlocation greatbrambience greatbrstaff greatbrrates nominalbrbr asian food comprises of bland and pungent taste among starters mushroom dumplings were good but small in quantitybrspeaking of main course we went for braised vegetables with mushroom in garlic sauce yaki udon and pan fried noodles braised vegetables were okay but quantity of garlic sauce was less yaki udon were less spicy and pan fried tasted good overall the menu offered variety but the taste lacks that bland and pungent quality perhaps just a suggestion to add more sauces along with the menubrcompared to tao chi kitchen offers much variety in the food along with the sauce i was searching for a place to sit down on a warm saturday morning munch sip something and work tattenham mostly did the job well its a lounge but unlike its peers it isnt dark or too loud there was enough of natural lighting and the staff was courteous enough to lower down the volume of the music as soon as i opened my laptop bri ordered cheese fritters and vegetarian brochettas i expected the dishes to be hot and mouth watering but they were just about average except the fact that both were plated well brthe staff is very professional and they do give personal attention no one would bother to disturb you even if youre sitting there for long hours brtwo dishes along with couple of nonalcoholic drinks costed me about 800rs which is fairly decent this place needs no mention it is already high up in the list i have been here twice and the place is just amazing brthe interiors are just up to the mark with lights furnitures exposed brick walls and not to forget the bar elevation brthe service is great it also has an outdoor seating cum smoking area the two level of seating provides enough personal space thereby making it perfect for dates brenjoy your time with drinks and food and also give a minute to the presentation 👍🏻 order anything and you will not be let down do specially try whiskey glazed mutton burger and four mixed drink shotsbratleast visit once and i assure you will hit this place again n again cheers tattenham corner came to me impromptu of course being in jehan numa has its perks and tattenham enjoys all of thatbrgreat interiors good service great wine and a notsogood pizzabrbut i am sure i can sit there all day i was recommended this place by a few friends my expectations were comfortably low however on taking my first step inside this place i found this to be a lot more open and inviting than most pubs and breweries id been to in the major metropolitans amazing ambience wonderful service the sangria i ordered was made with sula wines and i could see the food on par with the jehannuma standards very classy very elegant would definitely recommend it especially for people who love their drinks in a quiet quaint and beautiful setting this is a place where i have had some amazing times with friends a few years back when bhopal used to be the quiet and small place i grew up in this was one of the few places where you could hangout with friends that had better crowd than the usual places now of course with the malls springing up the story is different br whenever i am in bhopal this place still pulls me to itself the heavy wooden and dark interiors make the ambiance perfect for a beer or two while munching on the cheesy bits and nuts the staff is courteous smart and well behavedbrbr all in all one of the best you can get in bhopal woah probably the best bar in the city in terms of ambience and make me feel rich experience happy hours is the best time to go for pocket friendly people nicely designed service is very good best part is no smoking allowed inside the bar snacks are also tasty best place to hangout and have a chilled woodpecker draught beerbri recommend to go before 8 pm to get happy hours offer brchips are complimentary and nachos are delicious cool place with some good music on the house crowd is so sobrbartender is 👍👍brbeer served👌👌brappetizers 👊brnice place on hilltop with nothing around best bar in

which they agreed to take back the dish and serve another one some time later they brought the same dish in which they had added little bit sugar to the noodles to balance out the salt and after taking one bite i found a cockroach in the dish to which the owner replied it mightve flown from somewhere else because our kitchen is cleanbrbrsuch an irresponsible attitude towards customers

very good ambience the food was great and so was the ambience highly recommend probably the best restaurant and bar in bhopal in terms of service food and ambience they serve the best cocktail in a very fancy way talking about the food you should try rocket and bocconcini pizza green cheese edamame dal makhani paneer lababdar is must try great taste the beat pan asian food in bhopal better than house of ming also delicious food instructions were duly followed the sweet note by the team can make ones day corns were very much soggy today the prawns provided were half cooked n not crispy at all it seems that the food is prepared in a hurry disappointed there was a strand of hair in my food sushi can be better sushi wasnt sealed properly momos were okay crispy honey chilli were really liked my favourite was the chef special thai veg soup might order for soup again as always fabulous 🤩 my order was delivered very very late but everything else is good yeh restaurant aapko sazaa dena chahta hai inke yahaan se khana order karne ki they overcharge for very small portions please save your money and order proper food from other places so you can get a proper meal for 500 rupees instead of getting a joke in a box i got a stomach infection after having this soup it was worth the money it was not at all upto the mark loved it \\U0001fa77\\U0001fa77\\U0001fa77 all items were properly packed hot n appetizingbrexcellent in all aspects the rainbow sushi was so good however the rice was a bit undercooked container of the food was not suited for hot food items entire for got spoilt because of hot liquid poured in plastic container that wasnt meant for handling hot food extremely disappointed and digusted container changed its shape due to hot liquid best oriental food in town this is a regular place for me to order quantity is good and quality as expected however for this order not satisfied with the manchurian since the photo on zomato is not matching with actual dish gravy based with man balls hope this gets rectified i visited the giant panda recently it was a weekend and ordered noodles rice noodle dishbrit was half cooked chicken pieces were severely stinky breven the service person the waiter was little rude and had “i dont care” attitudebrno hard feelings to the owner but you need to take care of services perfect as always ⛔️ caution ⛔️ brthey do not accept zomato gold after 7pm so i guess it’s useless brthe taste was average wrong dish received we really loved the food specially dimsum and the sushi the delivery from zomato was totally flawless really appreciated the whole experience tthanks sushi roll was too thick not palatable at all good food amazing as always the pizza bread was not fresh and it tasted bad as its not at all fresh and also was not even hot the cheese was so cold and no much pizza sauce too all together hopeless the taste of the food was soo good one of the best place to order from and definately the best for asian food in bhopal simple awesomeness we always end up there courteous staff serene ambience and soulful food always we really like the food here having stayed in china japan hong kong for several years the food really brings back nice memories sitting here in bhopal it would be great to have a few more varieties of sushis packaging of sauce not adequate spilling was there greatly packaged and a well written note food was also very good poorly made dumplings the sheet was too thick and the filling was not flavoured not expected from giant panda the dishes smelled stale either some vegetable or the sauce was not fresh delightful food always comes well packed and warm best oriental in this area thanks for the nice note on top poor taste very bad food and stale pad thai noodles and thai spring rolls were pathetic never expected such less quantity of food… bad experience for the first time this panasian gem nailed it with their veg khow suey – an explosion of flavour the coconutbased broth was rich and the noodles soaked up all the goodness and about the lotus stem with vegetables – crispy perfection each bite was a delightful crunch if youre into bold flavors and a veggie feast this spot is a winner the prawns soba noodles were extremely spicy and too much soya sauce was added which made it quite sour and salt was a little bit high as well this was the first time i tried noodles here and was disappointed the prawns hargao i loved as usual and it was really good just like last times rice were so spicy and nothing like the description very heavy felt sick after consuming not my bowl of soup very good 👍 it was good but not as it has always been veg golden triangle had a smell of non veg couldnt eat it even being a non vegetarian please make sure your lamb is not undercooked i have had stir fried lamb from your restaurant multiple times and each time half of it is undercooked and incredibly chewy the best food i have ever tried wish i could eat the food all the time to whoever came up with the recipes and to whoever implemented them so nicely you all are doing an amazing job i can never get tired of this place everything you serve is delicious and screams of hard work the kung pao chicken was a bit too sweet this time but rest of it was very tasty keep up the good work worst food ever not so fresh good attempt at making thai noodles but still taste is nowhere near actual thai noodles delivered at the right time and was enjoyed during the train journey bralso served food was hot enough wonderful staff great food and perfect ambience awesum authentic chinese taste with high quality products brno excuse for less vegs and quick delivery the salad was not good all the sauces are bitter due to unproper packing not worth at all loved the taste except the wasabi everything was as per expectations thank you so much for the lovely note it made my day looooooveee the food thank you for being awesome 😊😊 the paneer in the paneer kang pao was was really extremely hard and chewey too oily the description says it’s made in clay oven but it is stir fried with a thick coating not to be confused with oven bbq without corn flour coating this needs to be clearly described brbrtossed away the whole order they don’t know how to make pad thai everything is wrong about it even the red chilli sauce that came as a condiment was spoiled awesome 👌 as always my family loves it specially my elderly parents authentic taste suits their stomach at this age keep up the good work 👍 day by day quality is getting bad the sauces were all leaking it was not properly packedbrnoodles were over fried not a good experience at all thik thak osm food simple paranthas and tawa roti given pathetic service always impressed by the food quality quantity amazing wow thanx food quality and quality is impressive quick tasty and value for money food wrong items delivered plus the taste and quality of the food is not up to the mark really disappointed seems like the rating of the restaurant is inflated to mislead the customers literally the best veg thali food taste is below average except roti bakwaas thaali stale quality was not good i am not satisfy your order nice this is so disappointing😞😞😞 ordered paneer pakoda yesterday lunar stay sent 10 pakodas with handmade delicious green chutney i took it for granted that they would maintain the quality so ordered again today i get 8 pieces of pakodas with shitty chemical based over the counter ketchup yukkkk ruined my evening check the photo received only curry but ordered a combo kaju curry gravy felt staledal was awesomerice was also good quantity is reasonable and packing is good sahi khane nhi tha very bed खाना ताजा नहीं था चिकन कुछ दिन पुराना था chiken ka test bhot achha thaa chef me kala hai the roti was made with stale flour and the restaurant did not follow instructions 1 aloo paratha for 60 rs good pricebrbut 1 gobi paratha with dahi 140rs really i thought 2 gobi paratha were coming in the price so i ordered furthermore the dahi was too sour like it was old the worst paneer ever had it feels like it has been kept in the fridge for ages i recently had the pleasure of enjoying a simple yet utterly delightful meal of daal chawal sabji and roti and i must say it was an absolute treat the daal was perfectly spiced with a rich comforting flavor that paired beautifully with the fluffy rice the sabji was cooked to perfection bursting with fresh vibrant vegetables and a blend of spices that hit all the right notes but the star of the meal was definitely the roti – soft warm and perfectly layered it had that homemade touch that instantly transported me to a place of comfort this meal was a perfect example of how simplicity when done right can truly be divine highly recommended for anyone who loves authentic wholesome indian food good quality food nice taste good packing and reasonable quantity good taste good quantity good service in hotel food test was osm very tasty frankly guys the best food available in bhopal both in taste quality and hygiene lunar stay is unbelievable😍😍😍 packaged food is very bad quality and taste is bitterplz block these hotel from zomato पेकिङ सहित नहीं हैं the taste is not good at all very bad service very very bad quality 😔 the pizza was totally cold and seasonings were less exceptional i did not give you a carrybag and the chocholava was very cold good nice small place good ambience very humble flexible staffowner fantastic taste value for money taste is really good so far still i suggest you add veggies in cube instead of julian cuts bahut hi kharab no paneer in the zingy parcel and the size was very very small not worth 75 hardly it should be for rs 30 very bed test yami pizza 🍕 ok ok taste not too good specially pizza taste not good worst the food was just full of mayonnaise very bad taste no cheese at all pathetic ordered choco lava cake but received brownies instead hot garlic dip nhi mila hame i paid 140 for a nutella waffle they gave me quarter of a waffle not even folded it was just a slice and nutella which must not even be half a table spoon and worst packaging ever like better buy a britannia cake of rs 20 very bad average best pizza and garlic bread worst service i have ever faced garlic bread missing package is open seal is broken already very poor food quality wrong dish was delivered and no response later superb not good not best but valve for money the pizza sauce tastes weird cold havent received seasonings pizza slice were all spilled and cold as hell how am i supposed to eat cold pizza slice pura bekar hai sada hua tuta hua i want my refund dry and burnt from sides service needs improvementbrfood was okbrambience is good thoughbrloved the vintage victorian feel here fan of their food service and hospitable approach it’s my go to place now in bhopal brhoping that they could add more items to their menu from here on if you want to go to a place to waste your time and money this is it i waited an hour for my food and the mocktail that i got was terrible to top it all off instead of being apologetic the staff wasn’t bothered they do not accept payment or booking from zomato they are just fooling and also they have very slow service i had to pay twice when i visited because they were not accepting payment from zomato and also soo rude that they said it’s not our fault you should tell us before and all these things i loved this place it has a great ambiance best suited for chilling with friends or datesbri had peach ice tea smoked paneer samurai pizza mocha and grilled chicken with some sauce i would rate it 5 stars for the taste of food and staffbrthey also have a banquet hall which can be booked for different functionsbrgive it a visit 🙂 the “globetrotting” owners of the cafe should actually com back and see what’s happening at their cafe the chargrilled chicken burger we ordered came after 40mins with a stale frozen chicken patty filled with pathetic mayo ambience is good pasta and cheese pull buns were super delicious 1010 for them❤️😋 refreshing ginger ice tea is love😌💓 my go to place💯 must visit food was great and service was really fine and waiters are polite the ambience is very peaceful and serene food is also delicious only drawback of this place is that people are allowed to smoke in the premises which is not a comfortable experience for other customers specially non smokers and children the ambience of this place is really good since it is a culmination of 3 cafes the service is not that efficient the food from bread n better was average we tried paneer tikka puff and alfredo pasta the drinks were pretty bad especially raspberry gingerale cooler the dessert cheesecake feels like whipped cream and cream cheese whipped together and slathered on a soggy crust the apple oatmeal crumble pie was the only thing that i actually enjoyed overall the vibe is good but the food can be improved hands down the best cafe in town the ten is the perfect place to hang out with friends and family both and the best part is that this is the only pet friendly cafe and hotel in bhopal its literally an oasis in the middle of the city and has something for every taste pallet and to top it all i can assure youll find the best coffee here i am writing this review after trying everything at the ten from their breakfast to dinner the coffees and the desserts it is all just brilliant kudos to the owners and the team the place is just amazing and within no time ive become a regular here you are the service and good for taste brburger very testy its one of the best cafe of bhopal the food ambience everything is just great they have 2 sitting space one is open and another one is air conditioned the open spac is very beautiful and peaceful with machan sittings with greenery all aroundbrthe cafe opens for breakfast as well and they have some great options in global and local breakfast they are serving the best omlette and pancake i had in bhopal loved the place and the vibe it’s a cozy cafe great for a date liked the mediterranean pizza but the bombay sandwich was not upto the mark it wasn’t hot the taste was okiesh too overall a good cafe not recommended for people from outside bhopal very delicious and enough quantity didn’t like the taste of food lose package oil was spilling they dont know how to cook hyderabad biryani chicken should be cooked more taste is ok okbrservice is hell bad waiters don’t listen at all they have a very bad attitude brit is reflected on zomato dining but there they disagree to take payment from zomato or swiggy its only after i threatened them to shoot them saying this they accepted payment through zomatobrbrvery bad service it ruins ur entire experience of dining out quantity of paneer in paneer lababdar is very less test was good biryani can be better everything is delicious very bad taste bikul pasand ni aya flavours thode km the you should increase spiciness little bit more otherwise okay please pack well next time the food is not delivered by a rols royes itll be a two wheeler always mind it please best food quality best service received wrong order after trying their number to replace my order it was switched off this shahi paneer is very sweet wasn’t good this time last time when i order taste was amazing but this time taste is not that type best butter chicken in bhopal the ambience was good food was just ok the restaurant was initially not accepting zomato payment and not giving the said discounts had to argue with the owner to get it accepted the food is smelling and rotten as it is 1 or 2 day old overall good it was just the overburnt garlic that was ruining the taste otherwise all good with quality quantity and packing hedrabadi biryani so delicious very bad sabudana khichdi was very oily i was veryy spicy nice packing and good quality too much spicey mirchi bahut dala hai aloo gobi meh bekar tha mene mirchi kaam k liye bataya tha very nice the chhola was too oily spicy i gave instructions which they didnt follow also bhatura was too much rolled worst taste ever sent wrong order chole were very oily gave it 2 stars rasmalai is the only thing i think was great so gave it a 5 star dal kachori was sent very stale so gave it 1 star wont be ordering again from this place horrible and full of oil which was dripping out from the kachori kachori is deep fried we understand that but a kachori pouring out oil is too much highly poor quality and definitely unhealthy to be avoided at all costs tasty and hygienic well packed food they accepted my request to send aaloo in different container preparation was good bt it was quite expensive provide better cupcup was broken the lime soda was pathetic too salty and in gathiya there was a foul smell puris were broken and was unable to enjoy pani puri due to that kindly look into that soya chap was stinking and was not appropriate to consume chola was taste but bhatura was too thick amd oily not good no test not tasty avarage cheese cigar roll is a must try dish great taste the packaging is not good the oil is floating out from the packaging onions are not freshly cutted i didnt get panner and rice in it too much bitter brtaste like seeds are also crushed in it terrible tasteless food doesnt worth the price charged awfully experience ek number ka ghatiya delivery man was bataneez laccha paratha was burned around the corners very bad food qualitynot upto the mark never ever again order the thali very nice experience but please try to avoid cardamam in schezewan chutney the test was worse very spicy and very oily never ever eat this type of food naam bade aur dharshan chaote wala hisaab there was dead insect in the tikki with chutney good food the taste of the food was good in both the thalis but the packaging of deluxe thali was too tight i had to use a knife scissor and apply all my effort to open the package secondly the quantity was very little as per the price of the dish one big section was empty and half of the papad was filled there instead they could have filled rice there at this price they should have kept veg pulao instead of rice in deluxe thali also there was no option to choose between breads which was a big downside too pricey less quantity tasty food didnt liked dosa at all looks like they sent stale dosa also it was not cooked properly disappointed pav bhaji was good ordered food tbrrestaurant sent incomplete food missing when raise complaint on zomato they denied restaurant admitted about the incomplete food they sent but zomato denied not even listening or trusting the customers scam both the restaurant and zomato lot of item were missing and food was not at all fresh सोया चाप खराब भेजा गया है । बदबू आ रही है ।खाने योग्य नहीं है। ऑर्डर वापस लिया जाए और पैसा लौटाया जाए। the momos are too spicy you should decrease the amount of green chillies you put in momos dahi ke sholay were bitter and runny the momos were good i ordered pav bhaji and the bhaji was way too much oily i removed 3 spoons of oil from the bhaji worst sbji its to spicy not taste good paneer lavabdar was spicy and dal makhani has no cream and butter the burger patty was rotten too spicy and half cooked 🥪 i dont even know how to make a sandwich i ordered one yesterday and it tasted very bad and about the delivery he said that it will come in 25 minutes and it will be delivered in 45 minutes it was very spicy bri even informed them in prior to make it less spicystill too oily and spicy please do not accept the request if you cannot fulfil it i have asked not to make it spicy and keep it simple even after that there was lots of oil and chillies in that testless bashi food delivered good but colty they should send little bit extra onion and pickle 3 hairs found in sambhar sambhar was tasteless corn palak contained shoots of palak the gravy of khadai paneer has so much onion and has less gravy so i suggest to add more gravy rabdi rasgulla is top of the world very very bad quality food full waste of money if possible issue refund food was not fresh everything was very very bad not going to use zomato and will never order anything from such a worst restaurant tilkaram there is dish washing scrubber wire on eating it was much oily order was late and the staff wasnt supportive send wrong order brladoo sent instead of kaju katli very bad good in taste found coachroach in pizza box and chena box is totally melt very good kesar laddu is expired and is smelling paper masala dosa me chatni k dabbe me aaloo diye the mere ye kehne k bad bhi ki aaloo jyada dena itne se aaloo me koi kaise paper masala dosa khayega worse in taste naam ka francize h bas bilkul achha nhi diya khana quantity is not sufficient both the chutneys that were sent with the sambhar had gone bad and there was a smell worst not at all good not even tasty i placed an order for pao bhaji and the bhaji was excessively oily and appeared to be stale the excessive amount of oil used in the preparation of the bhaji was unappetizing and detracted from the overall dining experience i ordered paneer fried momos yesterday and it taste like rotten and smelly i eat one or two and today i got sick having vomiting and loose motion i ordered peda mini n the sweet i received was completely different and staleit had a very bad tastewen i contacted zomato they shared a closed ended choice to receive rs 20 as credit and wen i called restaurant they didnt receive the callits like taking rotten sweets n getting rs 20 in return they are following bad practice i have ordered 34 times sweets from there and the observation is they send old and just about to expire sweet items whose taste has just started getting changed like rasmalai and rabdi rasgulla if you visit directly they give fresh items but sending old items on zomato order i am not commenting based on one time experience i have experienced it 34 times thats why today taking time out to share my feedback the taste of the chaap was great completely recommended very cold dated poori bhaji had to throw away all food fearing food poisoning what a waste of money taste was not good and satisfactory poor taste samosas are not spicy either add more spices or add option for fried chillies sandwich bread was to hard cooking request were fulfilled thanks besan barfi taste is not good and rasgullah is very very meethas taste good but found a french fries in my pao bhaji next time pls send manchurian in it steam veg momoskhandvi and rabdi are a must delivered old food stuff its shocking on one item no use by date is mentioned the food was too spicy and also the quantity of the food was very less as per the price in thali also the idli was not baked properly and completely wet quality was not good nce taste better chaap is available out there in the city you may avoid chaap from this store due to portion taste presentation etc 2pov likha kr ek hi dete h the chutney was very good but the sandwich were not up to expectations fir bhi nhi bheje ab train mein plates bgera nhi bheje the taste is pathetic the panipuri paani is too teekha sirf mirchi ka taste aata hai aur kuch nai malai kofta was very bad it tastes and looks like gatta more than malai kofta never ever gonna order again order bahut late aaya almost 2 gahnte me

worst restaurant poor taste chutney was very less the inner stuffing of samosa seemed fresh but the maida was old the dhoklas had some kind of oil on the side not ordering again from this place last time also they sent old stale kachoris atleast businessmen in the olden days would pack fresh food now they think they are clever to send old food items and take customers money but karma does come back so definitely not ordering again oily and stale food no plates given no cutlery they are making fool to make money this is just a kajoor with 3 almond inserted nothing else ordered 200gm laung sev got a call that they will be putting ratlami sev but i ordered 200gm but received only 150gm rasmalai fluid was like a sticky slurry very oily clearly doesnt taste like a paneer tikka there is only mayonnaise instead of chesse and very less vegetables are there in veg cheese pizza i asked without onion and garlic big tasty dosa but rawa dosa was too oily i have tasted tilakrams food earlier and it was really good but the experience with thali was so bad the paneer dal makhani and mix veg had ko taste at all it all tasted the same the raita was spoiled and was too sour one papad was a bit burnt the whole thali felt like a tasteless plate very disappointed the item ordered was really very spicy as hell it gave me ulcerations best food very good taste and packaging only one sambhar

zamato restaurant was unreachable to take a complaint and they are unable to take the order back or return the money decide who is in fault and decide and order at your own risk non courteous and rude behavior of captain and restaurant asst manager even to permanent customers this attitude is the 1st sign of restaurant services going down food was just amazing🤤 pazta was the best i have tasted in bhopal🍝 i was highly impressed by their diverse menu which offers a wide range of cuisinesbri tried the veg green thai curry with jasmine rice dynamite chicken sushi and panna cotta the green thai curry was the creamiest curry ive ever tasted and absolutely to die for the sushi was incredibly flavorful and the panna cotta was refreshingly light providing a perfect ending to the mealbrbrthe ambiance and attentive service further enhanced the dining experience food was bland service was not up to the mark the food is quite different than usually offered its blend of different flavours and presentation is stands out they have wide variety of exquisite options in food and drinks menu hence explains the expensive side as crowd is maintained the ambience and the food is really awesome the menu offers best of indian pan asian and continental cuisinesbri tried the sushi and it tasted heavenly also the lotus biscoff tiramisu is a perfect end to a dinner need to keep it less expensive in

can not expect from you 😡😡😡 the food was really very spicy and not up to the mark it smelled so bad i couldnt taste anything other than spice the food was stale also the chopsey was really damp so much oily i am a regular customer of the restaurant and order biryani regularly but today it smelled unfresh a mesmerizing experience i felt i was transported into a paradise the decoration was stunningly creative the concept of under the tree with a rustic décor and suspended lanterns was enchanting the best restaurant eating experience in bhopal the resort feeling of the hotel is simply amazing i must have been to this place at least 10 times over the last few yearsbrbrthe menu is extensive replete with numerous varieties furthermore the food added up to the grandeur of this place the place had an indian touch of stalls for serving the starters i went for tomato and basil soup delhi chaat paneer tikka and roasted broccoli for the main course i tried paneer kofta and dhabe ki dal which were all lip smacking brbrthe staff is hospitable i just wish that their staff is much more accommodating in our requests than they are esp when you are one of the priciest restaurants in the town and we are a regular customer its our favourite place to have a weekend brunch with family friends food is delicious and i love veg barbeque platter they use organic vegetables and things to prepare dishes ambience is awesome we always enjoyed our visit there if you have enough to spend on a luxurious brunch this is the place you must try when in bhopal they have absolutely delightful menu of soups and salads with just amazing sides also we tried quite a few mocktails and they were greathad them create a colour combination for us the vegetable sandwich was soso but the burger was one humongous meal in itself the beauty in and around the place is palpable and unmatched a must visit😍 if you can afford then a must visit place broccoli spinach soup was too good caesar salad ingredients were all there but somewhere the taste was missing but not that bad biryani was light and you will not feel heavy and too spicy so overall a good pick and taste portion size for everything is good just the prices are too high you should take out some time to roam on the property well architected with natural green surroundings if you are lucky then you might get a table here as they have come a long way and bhopalis have welcomed them with open armsbralthough quite expensive on one hand but the experience is worth it they will not offer you any failed recepie but have a really good menu and also the taste jehnuma is known for its hospitality and that why many a times its a full house in my recent visit to under the banyan tree by jehnuma peaceful atmosphere and surrounded by lush greenery beneath the tree the service surpassed expectations offering a truly exceptional experience however while the food was decent it didnt quite meet the mark of greatness nevertheless i highly recommend this venue for special occasions with family and loved ones sunday brunch is best an enchanting dimly lit evening brrecently had a beautiful evening my experience is as follows brbrlocation and ambience brbrthe location of this place is just outstanding incredible it’s located in lush green area beyond sair sapata by surrounding water body of the lake with peace nowhere you

interiors and when the sounds of nature creates a vibration it just refreshes your mindbrit is just perfect for a couple date and also for family outing that goes without saying i personally recommend this place for a dinner for me it was is just outstanding it also has waiting cum play area and also a private dining space to be booked beforebrthe food will take you to another level of experience i

lighting and the warmth of the bon fire by ur side was a perfect match to it courteous staff quick to respond happy to serve you with a smile had a chicken coriander soup which was filling but not tasty as a chinese soup should be murg tikka was very juicy tender and scrumptious for the mains it was pindi channa and dal the channa was spot on but i think the dal could be a more garlicky the

the ambience is fantastic to know that they use home grown veggies organically was a delight bra must do while in bhopal sat in the inside restaurant as it was a chilly evening terribly slow service it took 15 mins to get some water to drink after the states and then took more than 2 hours to get to the main course once the main course arrived and the curries were served it took more than 20 minutes to get the breads walked out the restaurant without finishing the dinner the manager though insisted on taking some dinner home but it was too little too late under the jamun tree as the name says best country side experience thali 😍😋 little expensive but worth visiting it was a lunch with loved ones on a special occasion and day brno doubt about the locationambianceplacing of the restro it is worth spending time together giving a peace to eyes and selfbrnow lets see food n drinkschicken starter was nicebeer was good obvsly they had only kfuuff shorba with garlic bread was decent

also anywhere at the propertybrbroverall apart from foodwe had good time and experience but yaahfood😒🤐 very very poor service even after being a very old customer of jehan numa and knowing people

counter for 20 mins till it is baked had no option but leave my meal mid way a perfect place to spend your sunday the ambiance the live music the foodeverything was on point the brunch buffet costed around rs1100 without taxes and it was worth it we started with the chaats there were quite a lot of options available like aloo tikki papdi chaat palak pakoda gol guppe etc the starters were limited but delicious the main course was quite good with varieties of curries and dals the best part was the desertsss we had kheer beetroot halwa and mousse never thought beetroot halwa would taste so amazing as the weekend slips through commencing a new week with a lazy sunday morning you might happen to skip breakfast to chase down those mid morning hunger pangs a perfect sunday brunch is what

loved the food i had tandoori bharwan aloo for starters it had a perfect balance of each and every flavour potatoes were perfectly cooked neither too loose nor too hard then i had matar paneer maa ki dal and aloo dhaniya kulcha for main course it was such a heavy meal i loved each and every dish served ambience is perfect for candle light dinner and family dinners away from the hustle and bustle of the city this place is so peaceful and relaxing the staff is well trained yet i didnt find them polite this place is pretty clean and hygienic seatings are comfortable but during night mosquitoes can be an issue as it is an open restaurant i would suggest everyone to visit this place at least for once you will love it taste of mutton korma was awesome but the stomach upset i got wasnt so awesomebrotherwise the ambience is one of the best in bhopal with well mannered staff ok straight away starting with the food quality 355 i ordered garlic bread and pasta which was somehow tasty but not extraordinary can be considered it above averagebrambience and service is what forced me to give 45 out of 5 actually i reserved a candle light dinner the way the staff treated us was like a movie date scene rolling onbrwelcomed us in a polite gesture by all the waiters standing on both sides as soon as we sat down all disappeared in their respective work list of all the gestures is very long chuck itbrif you want to spend time in a quiet place with such lovely ambience this is the perfect place for you well maintained and open kitchen is one of the best attractionbrps do check the status

worth the hype if you are really interested in eating good food brbrthe decor the ambience everything is perfect you need to do advance booking as there are very limited tables we started by ordering tamatar dhaniya shorba it was nice hot and spicy but thicker than a usual shorba basically it was a soupbrbrthen for appetizers we tried their paneer achari tikka and dahi ke shami paneer was not cooked well and marination and spices were very less dahi ke shami is on the sweeter side we alos tried their veg biryani which was really good both taste na quantity wise also along with these we had naan missi roti dal makhani and aloo dum kashmiri all were averagebrbri have visited so many restaurants local as well as 5 stars but this one surely disappointed not worth the hype even thier cutlerys were smelling hope they work on their foodbrbri am giving 3 stars only for the ambience for food it will be only 2 starsbr this place is what dreams are made of away from the city sitting in

place is beautifully done under the tree literally decorated with lanterns sure to make it a lovely evening spot the place has an indian touch of stalls for serving the starters like chaat kebabs kathi rolls pizza pasta etc the grills are placed right behind and visible all starters are served on table and are ensured to reach in time i had tried almost everything bhel papdi chaat special request dahi puri pani puri chicken egg roll which i personally found best for the day black pepper white sauce pasta nv pizza grilled chicken kebab fish fingers mutton kebab not v great paneer tikka hara bhara kebab veg seekh kebab apart from blue ocean ice tea as welcome drink which i replaced with lemonade i didnt touch salads that daybrafter this much i strictly wasnt in a mode to eat main course i had a small portion of green thai curry and steamed rice which was v nicely made their mutton biryani had been done in dum style i was loaded with food by then but im sure it was a good deal the other main course spread included taar gosht chicken korma veg korma aloo katli paneer masala and breads brdesserts have been a good spread the serving for the day being avocado flavor vanilla nitrogen icecream apart from the bakery desserts cup cakes pastries coffee chocolate mousse chocolate truffle blueberry mousse caramel custard indian desserts gajar halwa which was a real delight n rawa payesh served in earthen bowl the custard was served with angoor gulabjamun which came out real well i wish i had more space to try all of them brthe live band with vivek singh had been a delight to ears he added a good cheer to the whole ambience brall in all the place is a must visit it was good 😄 loved the ambience and taste of the food ❤❤ but yes carry alot of cash with you if you reduce the prices a bit it would be one of the best fine dining places in bhopal 😊 if you are looking for a calm and peaceful place along with good food then under the jamun tree should be your place of choicebrthe ambience is rustic and fresh the greenery around fills in the positive vibes i have been to this place for both lunch and dinner and it has been a serene experience both the timebrcoming

55brin all it is an amazing experience in bhopal to dine at this restaurant we frequent this place the place is beautiful and the staff is very courteous the food isn’t great giving it a star because we found a nail in our food we showed it to the server and were told that it must have fallen in the tandoor also the taste of the vegetarian food has deteriorated a lot if you are coming for the ambiance you would like the place if you want good food go somewhere else you want to visit a resort which has a jungle resort feel within the city limitsthis is your spot a quaint resort located right next to van vihar national park and across the upper lake is set up with cottages and open air restaurant brbrunder the jamun tree has a beautiful setting with tiki torches lanterns setting up the mood rustic wooden furniture on gravel laden outdoor area with a huge jamun tree in the middle hence the name of the restaurant the main kitchen is hidden behind the huge bushes but the tandoor area and grill section is set up in the open on clay finished village style counters brbrthe service is outstanding staff is very courteaous and they make sure that you leave the place happy brbrwatermelon juice and the cucumber cooler was not good though juice seemed as if it was not made with fresh watermelonwhere as the cooler lacked ice flavour and bodybrbrthe maincourse was very well flavoured and served with love hare mirch ka keema was amazing the flavours of green chilli was just apt you could taste the real green chillies but the hotness was just enough that enhanced the the flavours of the well cooked mutton keema bhopali murgh rizala on the other hand was very subtly flavoured and garnished beautifully with boiled egg accompanied with roomali roti and bakhakani especially made on our request the meal was perfect brbrno good meal is complete without a good dessert to end it so we decided on calling the dessert to our room our choice was chocolate ganache to me it was a disappointment the ganache was more like a mousse with an overdose of mint which made it bitter and at a price point of 400 for a shot glass of mint mousse it was not a good preperatio at all a lovely open air restaurant under a jamun tree with live kitchen the food is delicious though the menu does not have wide variety of dishes but the ones which are there are awesome the price quotient is on a higher side ambience and service is very good one of the best restaurants in the bhopal the creativity in decoration and presentation of the food are outstanding if youre looking for a romantic evening that’s it amazing place lovely food genuine knowledgeable servers and extraordinary ambience been here twice and needless to say it was superb its damm luxurious and great the lanterns add to the appeal food items like chicken prep were greatbrbr went with a friend this place is one of the best restaurant in bhopalthis place has its own charm the royal feel and mouth

in bhopal no excessive oil ekdum ghar ka khana brbrlittle expensive because of its food and set up but worth paying during the holidays at bhopal i discovered a long lost friend unearthing him after 34 long years while our respective shapes and sizes underwent a whole lot of mutations the bonhomie never faded over time my friend hosted me an excellent dinner at the restaurant under the mango tree on a leisurely sunday evening for a journey down the memory lane the ambiance and food enticed me for a repeat visit to the restaurant next day with six of my family members brbron entering jehan numa palace of 19th century vintage and crossing over the plush hotel lobby we located the aptly christened restaurant under the mango tree with an ancient mango tree as its company the restaurant is open on all sides with a provision to extend dining arrangements in the lawns around during more agreeable climes we settled inside the covered area and truly fell for the environs the wicker furniture muted lighting in the eating area and a gently gurgling fountain in the lawns all added to the ambiance brbrwhile some of us chose the hard drinks specific brands on promotion at 50 discount two of us went for mocktails rs250 each a portion of murgh malai tikka rs565 was lapped up as the starter our main courses comprised a portion each of murgh biryani rs480 dal tadka rs260 mix vegetables rs300 nihari gosht rs615 along with tandoori rotis rs50 apiece for dessert we asked for vanilla ice cream with hot chocolate rs280 chocolate mousse rs300 and brownies with ice cream rs325 chicken tikka was quite pricey but tasted good chicken biryani cooked in awadhi style was rich with aroma and served in quantity enough to cater to two persons we also enjoyed the mutton nihari prepared in old delhi mughlai cooking style dal tadka and mix veg were nothing to write home about brbrjehan numa palace would score very high for the ambiance but its top dollar pricing for the quality of food served makes it little overrated i really appreciate the initiative that mudrakeswani and shashikkeswani have taken with mind shift mumbai and would surely take part in it thanks jnphretreat for the personalised menu and really good food and would like to tell everyone that they grow organic vegetables for their food within their 12 acres retreat with this food boss bhopal would rate jnphretreat 10 on 10 for best food service and ambience in bhopal which is a nature blessed retreat and would especially recommend chilly cinnamon icecream with plum and chocolate sauce br had been with team for dinner most disappointing evening ever the quality of food service no where close to what they charge prices are too high avg per person 2500 even though it was a company sponsored treat feeling so bad that we had to pay for something which is not worth will never suggest anyone ever add 28 prcnt tax to it very dissappointing under the mango tree fancy namebroften referred as the best restaurant in bhopal brwe actually went to shahnama but it was under renovation and we were asked to shift to utmt which opens only in the evening after 7 pm but its pretty clearbrour servers were great especially kavtakchi i am sorry i dont remember his exact namebrexpensive but totally worth itbrambience is amazing different aura all togetherbrfood is amazing as well we ordered dal shahnama cooked for 16 hour over charcoal their speciality and was a huge disappointment naan and khameri roti baigan mirchi ka salanamazing and fruit raitabrtheir speciality is the reason i am giving them 4 otherwise hell of a restaurant brwonderful staffbrseating is another aspect i wasnt impressed with especially with their compact tables not suitable for 3 or more peoplebranyway i will definitely recommend this restaurant to everyone a pure gastronomical delightbrfrom the butter chicken to the non veg starter platter to the desserts everything speaks classbra little expensive though 2000 bucks for two people depending upon the variety ordered if you are already fat like me and want to spend an evening in a verdant relaxing pseudo royal courtyard getting fatter while pretending you are a begum a wayward prince or the nizam of hyderabads nephew this is the place leave the kababs inside in the other eateries at jn and hit the collieries loaded malai broccoli the khumb malai palak or the yummy rajma galanti me im on a diet and i stick to the classic greek salad or the césar salad left over from la kuchinas brunch jokes aside this is a must visit place to eat in the middle of madhya

ceiling to your imagination the ideal chef should be able to relate to your mood with ingredients available to create magic as long as there is no change of staff this holds true herebrdont believe mecheck it out had heard a lot about this place so finally paid a visitthe restaurant located inside jehan numa palace offers a great ambience and on entering here u cant help but admire the beauty of the place had been here while it was raining and midway through my dinner i noticed the mango tree through the fibre glass window on topand then i realized why the name they have a barbeque styled kitchen right in front of the dining area and this place is great for barbeque the food is heavy on the pockets but the service here was really disappointingi was here on a sunday evening probably a busy evening for them the manager was clearly finding it hard to cater to everyone they were clearly understaffed i will give them a 4 for the ambience3 for the food and 1 for their poor service this has become one of my favourite places the ambience and the food both are amazing a little high on the budget but totally worth it must try i went to this place for dinner with family brwe ordered palak nuts based snack for starters it was just ok nothing exceptional to the price charged main course was goodand for dessert we ordered shahi tukda shahi tukda was really bad it was basically plain uncooked break dipped in sugar syrup and coated with rasmalais milk which ideally should hv been rabdibrit was pathetic the dessert spoiled our mood we gave this feedback to the waiter also who was reluctant to accept it overall not a great experience this place was on my wishlist from quite some time i had been to all the other restaurants of jehenuma palace except this last weekend my wish was fulfilled i went there with my family to celebrate my mothers birthday the ambience was serene and peaceful i love the instrumentals that play in the background though it has become quite a custom in bhopal we got a perfect table next to the garden which was the cherry on the cake since its a barbecue we ordered makhmali paneer and malai broccoli kebabs for the starters they were amazing i always thought kebabs are not for vegetarians but then this place changed my opinion for the maincourse we ordered a spinach based gravy with methi and potato balls that was not good the reason i couldnt give this place a complete five star otherwise service was fast and staff was courteous too it is very decent place the ambience is good as well as the food is up to the mark i enjoyed with my family thank you i would like to visit again this is a super restaurant in one of the most under rated cities and hotels masters elegance super nova food and great service keep it up and let the passion continue this place is the best in bhopalthe ambience is just perfectfood is good although vegetarian options are lessfull marks for hospitality and hygiene if you want to experience a candle light dinner sitting next to a jungle boundary with a royal treatment a delightful experience with superb service good food this is one of those places where you want to celebrate with family on a very special occassion a place where you want to have a business meeting in a safari stylebrbrhowever watch out for the bill a beautiful place with old world charm soothing music lovely service and paintings galore this place is just wonderful had a lovely dinner with my better half who enjoyed a negroni with kebab platter and bhopali mutton korma and bhopal yakhni pulao the kebabs were soft and flavour ful and the mutton dishes were extraordinarily delicious with soft tender mutton the service by hari was exceptional would love to try the other joints in this wonderful property cheers menu very selective menu including indian nd mughlai dishes serving kebabs shorbas curries nd cherry on d cake is the special dishes for pure vegans ie no onions no garlic dishes brambiance newly renovated nd as the name suggests have an indoor as well as al fresco diningbr it’s quite artistic aspirational which provides a heavenly view brdahi ke kebab a perfect blend of hung curd herbs nd spices with a sharp nd tangy taste served with green chutney nd chiffonade salad brmutton rara a delectable spices filled with a punch of aroma mutton dish a treat for ur eyes nd taste budsbrdal bukhara everyone’s favourite nd an ultimate velvety smooth lentil with n extraordinary taste br a must visit when in bhopal under the mango tree is a superb openair finedine restaurant located inside one of the best hotels in bhopal the jehan numa palace hotel the restaurant has ultrachic ambience and is especially delightful to have dinner there simply because of the greenery around it and the water fountain that jingles as you munch on your food the snacks are limited in variety but are mouthwatering delightful to have nonveg food there the kitchen is an open one giving its customers a complete view of the food being prepared you would find very different dishes like bhutte ki seekh etc in this restaurant the restaurant serves alcohol and offers a very pleasant evening time to its customers overall feedback too good a ancient palace converted to a hotel n listed as heritage hotel carrying a long history of bhopal bhopal is the place for mughal taste flavorsbrbrvisited here and had an buffe such a yummy food n collection of non neg n veg the starters are seekh kabab n shami kabab n chilly chickenbrbrall the varieties are well presented also had a awesome taste a must see place for everyone food was tasty specially galauti kebab seekh kebab and firni abhishek and manager bhusal were fantasticbrrooftop was closed but but overall good ambience what good is a restaurant if the food is utterly disappointing right from a simple dish like roomali papad which was served cold to nihari which was bland to hyderabadi biryani which was made with some cheap quality rice jehan numa managed to disappoint us with with every dish that we ordered if this wasn’t enough the staff who was supposed to bring us food kept on nagging us by asking “how was the food” totally not worth the money or the time only good part was the mango tree which to be honest you can find anywhere near the road jehenuma is one the finest dinning place in bhopal it has variety of dinning options apt for lunch or a dinner or even for a healthy breakfast buffet i have been to all the cusine be it under the mango tree or la kuchino or shahnama or everyones favourite cafechino 🙂 people can try different cusine starting from north indian food mughlai italian and customised al a carte menu my favourite is achari brocoli apart from food place is quite spacious one feedback i have for management is during any functions like marriage or similar engagements staff appears to be in quite hurry and they dont have time to address the people sitting for dinning or even for a cup of coffee as compared to noor e subah this place also have decent open space which can be utilised for better sitting arrangements happy dinning 🙂 an interesting name for a restaurant under the mango tree it has a beautiful location under a mango tree in an open verandah it seems to be a popular restaurant in bhopalbrbrwe were here for dinner and ordered only 2 dishes nonveg kabab platter and mutton biryani i am not a big fan of a platter you may land up with kababs you dont want on the other hand it gives you an opportunity to eat a variety of kababs brbrthe nonveg platter kabab platter had all the normal suspects sheekh kabab chicken tikka galoti these kababs were well made and tasty not too spicy next time i come here i will probably focus on sheekh kababbrbrthe muuton biryani was tasty and not too oily the rice exuded aromas of various spices the mutton was a bit chewy and disappointing brbrservice was efficient and ambience was great this restaurant is worth a visit great place to be what a lovely non veg starters they serve great mutton dishes they serve liquor there too as the name suggests its located just under the mango tree that makes it a perfect place to be this place has raised the bar so high that even the best of the places would be dwarfs in comparison the palace is so beautiful and the food is so heavenly tasty that every bite takes you back to the era of the nawabs i just tried frontier chapli kebabs and oh my god i have never had something so amazing before would always want to come back here to try every single dish on the menu i would say this place is a gem of india may this legecy lives on for 1000s and 1000s of years to come the place is really nice to dine with family and friends their service and gesture is one of the best in the city we found some part of the starter overcooked and complained for it they immediately took action and replaced it which is appreciable brbut the taste of food is just average and doesnt resemble what we expected from this placebrbrbe ready to pay 18 gst here as it is not a stand alone restaurant and they have room with its tariff more than 7500 beautiful open seating with amazing food from the kitchen of begums with authentic taste flavours and look makes this one of the best places to eat in bhopal brbrwe dined at the general’s dining table a private dining experience and were absolutely blown by the choices jehan numa palace is a one of its kind property in bhopal it has a beautiful and charming old world appeal their verandah restaurant under the mango tree makes for a romantic ambience perfect for quiet dinners the breeze is abundant and cool thanks to the lake nearby brbrtheir menu however is a little typical same paneer and chicken tikkas and hara bhara kebabs that are the stereotypes of north indian cuisine however the food quality is absolutely top notch the veg kebabs were creamy and soft and so was the chicken for the mains we ordered daal peshavari kadhi pakoda butter chicken and gobhipaneer bhurji the bhurji was a highlight lightly spiced and perfectly balanced flavours of the grated ingredients brbrif i ever return to bhopal will definitely want to spend a long evening here it is a nice place with good ambience and a warm atmosphere the place is ideal to visit with family or with someone special though finding a table on weekends may be a problem so if you plan to have dinner then book the table in advance food is good especially the nonvegetarian food apart from this restaurant in hotel jehanuma there are two more restaurants and a laid back coffee shop where you can chill with your friends with respect to price it is one of the most expensive places to eat out in bhopal the place is a little hyped up you would expect the food to be very authentic and different but it doesnt match up the the standards and definitely not to the price the tandoor starter platter was great much better than the main course the main course was dal dum aloo and panneer butter masala the dal lacked flavour and was very average the rest of the dishes were okay the ambience and service was good a hotel of the pataudis so you raise your expectation for the nawabi treat to your taste buds and it dint fail mine br murg lahori was done real authentic the rich and creamy gravy was just perfectbrthe meat was nice and juicybrbrthe ambiance is also good for a nice cold winterbrbrthough this tale is 7 years old i wonder if the taste is still kept intact the best murgh malai in the worldbr the barbeque is outstandingbr chapli kebabs to die for brthe platter is absolutely brilliant brgo home with a really stuffed tummy brin one word actually two food coma which is an amazing thing br went here with two of my friends for dinner soft music coupled with beautiful ambiance and quite palatable north indian food went well on my 25th birthday would love to visit again jehan numa palace’s best restaurant specializes in barbecue kebabs and tandoor dishes most things on the menu are topclass but the sampler platter of varied kebabs may well be the best meal you have anywhere in madhya pradeshgreat food candlelight dinner and excellent service all combine under a romantic white pavilion and the heavy boughs of a venerable centenarian mango tree they have an open air arrangement which has great ambience the staff is courteous and the service is good loved the paya soup and mutton roganjosh a must go to place for tourists and foodies really awesome service the ambiance was just lovely and relaxing accompanied by mouth watering food and an array of delicacies and a very professional staff best recommended if you are craving traditional food i decided to try this restaurant a day after diwali because of the excellent ratings on zomato excellent ambience i must say however our nightmare just began after ordering we had to wait nearly an hour to get our starters understandably the starters arrived cold the service was so bad that we had to plead for cutlery after all this brouhaha the main course arrived hot but alas the chefs had put either too much salt or no salt in the food we somehow finished our meal and escaped from this venerable institution of bhopalbr usually i enjoy the quality and taste of the food offered by jehanuma even though they have some highly hautghty and nonresponsive wait staff but this time the service was so unprofessional it seemed that they no longer required business from people was here for anniversary dinner sumptuous food and courteous staff simply made it worth the occasion one of those very few places that have impressed me with their mutton dishesmutton nihari pricy but makes for occasional visits contrary to the general perception i would not go out especially to have dinner here they do have some authentic preparations on offer and i have been on occasion found munching away under the mango tree but the keyword there is on occasion somehow their food does not entice me muchbrbrthe ambience is fantastic and its a great place to have a meal followed by indulgent conversation over a cup of coffee the meal will not have the zing in it but the ambience shall make up for it never recommend brbrmy first visit to bhopal and i thought of visiting this famous placebrtrust me the service and food very really disappointing the ambience was just ok brwe first ordered veg platter and we could not order further after the starter because that too was not up to the markbrsince we couldn’t eat much of it so we asked o pack the same for takeaway but to our further disappointment the packed meal missed the few good items that was there on left plate then what we asked them to pack had broccoli and paneer too but was they packed was just a lot and lot of potatoes and hara bhara kebab probably they kept the broccoli to serve in someone else’s platebrmajor disappointment it was and would never recommendbrbrjust to add in here zomato says they don’t offer alcohol but they do one of the most elite places of the city of lakes and a lovely place place to enjoy some amazing dinner with beautiful ambience the services toppes the charts and one of the places which is closest to my heart we visited this restaurant after 4 years and the first reaction of ours was to see this fully covered what once was an al fresco restaurant literally under the mango tree was now completely turned into fine dining restaurant and much to our disappointment with the rains even their arrangements of the al fresco set up on the first floor of the restaurant were closed anyhow since we were staying at the hotel we chose to have dinner here anyway and the happiness and satisfaction started coming back with each dish we called for the restaurant may have changed its set up but the punch of flavours it delivered back then is still the same brbrwithout getting into appetizers we straight away called for mains and our order wasbrbrmirch baingan ka salan methi kofta in palak gravy and lauki mussalam along with variety of kulchas naans and rotis brbrthe two dishes that really stood out were lauki mussalam and the khameeri roti we literally called for another portion of lauki a vegetable we never prefer eating at home leave alone paying for and calling in a restaurant however the stuffing of that perfectly delicious paneer inside the discs of lauki and the rich cashew nut based gravy was just lipsmackingly good also the khameeri roti very native to bhopal was crisp and crusted with seeds on top it was yeast added roti bread made fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside with the baking in tandoor surprisingly goodbrbrwe highly recommend this restaurant too and if you can really then please take the open air set up to eat food its still beautiful it was three of us on a fine sunday evening our belly was rumbling and we were yearning for some mindboggling food to help our cravings coming here turned out to be the best this is definitely my favorite restaurant in bhopal in terms of foodbrbri found the open air décor scintillating with a soothing and elevated ambiance service was well groomed and impressivebrbrbut it is the food which is stealing your heart away the menu was well curated we ordered some special delicacies i would mention some which can be devoured heartily in starters rajma galouti kebab palak chilkoze ki tikki hara bhara kabab paneer subz tikka could be the best choices for the main course paneer pasanda kadhi pakoda hyderabadi veg biryani totally contended heavenly food would like to come againbrbrambiance 55brfood 55brservice 45 excellent food and good service always can become stuffy during summers but best place for chilly evenings good range of bbq specially chicken malai tikka i make it a point to visit this place every time i’m in bhopal the ambience and the food has always been really good up until last night nothing changes on the ambience food was bit of a let down at least for the price i thought it was a bit pricey for a very ordinary stuff had booked a table for 5 for dinner but the experience was bad from the start the service was horrible the cocktails were very diluted the chicken rezala bhopali was a disaster for the taste budsbron the whole sad to say a hotel of your reputation should try and rectify your service and your cooks need to be better i was in bar but staff and service was not up to the mark doesnt seem like 5 star hotel bar though food was tasty other than food nothing was good it was just like any other bar in bhopalbr while the menu overlaps with the shahnama situated in the same premises the food which we tried out was on an average to good scale we tried the dungar ghost kebab which while being extremely succulent had a taste of spices undercooked the smoky flavor was also missing or probably the spices overpowered them the dal shahnama although creamy and well cooked dint have the oomph factor associated with overnight cooked dals ref dal bukhara the ambience is brilliant and you can expect to have a lovely dinner under the mango tree surrounded by the beautiful heritage property of the jehan numa i ordered galouti kebab butter chicken and saffron chicken tikkaextremely overpricey especially for the quantity they are givingthey are just charging for the ambience and for the propertyi wonder how dere avg rating is above 4a big nonot even worth a single pennya very big disappointmentspoilt our moneytime our dinner😒 come to this place on a cool breezy night and enjoy the delicious food in the lap of luxury the food is amazing and each item is cooked to perfection the portion size is incredibly small food is very oily the ambience is okay but there are flies and mosquitoes menu is very restricted and preparation is unsatisfactory authentic food is surpassed by long delivery time on table service staff very freindly ambience no doubt is exotic one of the best place to spend on sundays if you have little patience then this is not recommendedas it knocks your fast appetizing values but if you are one of those who have excluaive 4 hours for eating your mealsgo ahead if you live in bhopal or are just visiting this is a must place to visit the service is quite good and the welcome is warm the best part is the food the meats here are the best they just melt of the bone the rogan josh is one of the tastiest youll ever have jehan numa palace a heritage destination hotel in the city of lakes bhopal the mango tree is basically located under a longstanding mango tree in the central patio this is mainly known for barbeque and starters basically i visited with lots of high expectations after hearing a lot from my friends and family members but there is no such ambiance at this place so don’t raise your expectations before going it’s very simple place near a mango tree and a fountain which may made them bit rich in terms of location partially situated on a hill and yes here valet parking is available dbras a complimentary they offer white garlic bread with amul butter bread soup sticks peanuts in the appetizer we started with barbeque veg platter of all the starters it had baked potato grilled paneer stuffed tomato bell peppers some carrot cucumber lettuces onions hara bhara kahab etc the taste was nice but could have been better one can also try baked aloo i don’t remember the exact name which also looked bit attractive to mebrbrin the main course we had daal tadka and dum aloo kashmiri it was served with red gravy which was okay daal tadka was very good brbrin the breads we had tandori roti and butter naan it looked good but was all cold and became sticky this was because just after serving platter they served main course within some minutes after requesting manager they replaced 34th of the overall bread order with such a known hotel they don’t even know when to serve what this was not at all expected from high class palace brhospitality – 255 not up to the expectations i think they should hire some more staff so that they can server every table it looked like there were only 34 staff members including manager who was available in the lawn you may need to call them again and again for water or extra order by calling hey hey which was a complete disappointmentbrcost – expensive as compared to the hospitality received it would come around

for a family of 4 as the service staff was running out of space to arrange the food cutlery n drinks in the little space availablebrbroverall a very peaceful place to create wonderful memories i went first time here the place is slightly overrated in all aspect the staff is courteous but service is bit latebrthe prices are also very high according to the quality and taste of the dishes overall it was not up to the mark experiencebr my experience at under the mango tree was a classic case of disappointment served cold having been a patron of jehan numa since i was born not even exaggerating the fact that i had never visited this restaurant until last week strikes as slightly odd branyhow we made our reservations for a big family celebration party of 16 on a weekday we started off on a bad note with our soups being served lukewarm and low on seasoning the salt and pepper shakers salvaged what was salvagable and we patiently waited for our appetizers brso personally for me the murg malai tikka at jehan numa is the holy grail of all murg malai tikkas for me and what we were served didnot disappoint tender succulent creamy and perfectly flavoured we couldnt get enough of it brthe fish tikka again was disappointing and low on flavours what surprised me was that they managed to get their paneer tikka wrong it was absolutely bland and lifeless brfor mains we ordered the dal makhni which was nothing to write home about the mutton nihari was practically a serving of meat floating in oil it broke my heart putting this food in my tummy a certain fish curry we ordered though was pretty delicious and i recommemd it i cannot recollect the name but the servers will be happy to recommendbrservice was good nothing over the top the ambience is chill and apt for a relaxed dinner bralthough i would battle the storms and wage wars for their murg malai tikka i dont believe i will be visiting this restaurant anytime in the near future a perfect place for a date and a candle light dinner awesome food with an awesome ambiance food is just great kesar chicken is heavenly the kebabs are soft and tastybra thumbs up for this place and postdinner one can roam about in the palace which is the heritage hotel food is not worth the price ordered prawns curry prawns were unkooked and hard chicken tawa fry and roghan ghost had ordinary veg gravy shahi tukda had very soggy bread avg price per person for food is 2000 we were in a group of 17 best property in townquality foodvery beautiful environmentservice was goodpresentation was nicemust try non veg food here went for a casual evening the ambience is beautiful with a mango laden tree candles and soft music it sets the tone for a perfect evening the service was courteous however it was the food that was a total let down order palak shorba makai pine nuts kebab the makai shorba was not at all tasty the bread served with shorba was dry the kebabs had big lumps of paneer cheeseneither mashed properly nor cooked properlybrbrthe 3 star is only for ambience and service didnt expect this kinda food being a food connoisseur i do not like digging into mughlai and awadhi food at random places an unnecessary comparison to the food cooked at home kills the food anyway nonetheless under the mango tree was a pleasant surprise the sous chef tells me vividly how their team keeps visiting the royal family of bhopal for constantly revising the recipes and their taste i found it hard to believe till i actually tasted the food the tandoori chicken is served interestingly in a small tandoor while the paneer tikka comes hanging and smoked the royal dal is the standout it is cooked over 16 hours and the taste vouches for itthe best thing though was the shahi tukda considering my love for it i ensure that i do not eat the shahi tukda anywhere expect at my own house reluctantly i tried it here and was floored my arrogance with the shahi tukda needed a punch like this pankhi kebab is the first thing that gets in my mind when ever i visit this place have been loyal to this restaurant for over a decade now and it’s just a superb place for non vegetarian cuisines now since they have made another floor the top seating area is also amazing the food portions have drastically improved what i can compare of the staff has always been courteous and the service has always been prompt i can say that this is the best restaurant in bhopal for nonvegetarian mughal cuisines naam bade and darshan chhotebri thought this was most exciting place in bhopalbrworst servicesbrstarters arrives after the main

restaurant anywhere in the world in kebabs and curries they dont apply any shortcuts or run of the mill assembly line cooking techniques of big restaurants whether standalone or at 5 stars every item is as authentic as it can get the proof of which is the local highend aristocratic clientele who wouldnt come if the preparations were fake seen here are the desi freerange country chicken quorma nallinahari and pasanda all outstanding surpassing expectation dont miss a meal here when in bhopal such classic finedining restaurants are fast disappearing from this part of the world while staying there in jehan numa i went to under the mango tree which is authentic tandoor restaurent i had chapli kebab and seeks kebab both were really good especially chapli kebab one must try that if they gone

in the middle of the palacea mixture of nawabi and modern culture and gives you a royal experience not far from citybrits a barbecue restaurantbrfood is nice with subtle flavours so if youre looking for fine dining experience then you wont get disappointed late post alertbrbrlocated within one of the most prominent hotels jehan numa palace the restaurant was on our bucket listbrbrthe ambience was chic and a very friendly staff however the food felt short of our expectations and we feel the food could have been slightly better and tasteful one of the best place in bhopal to have a romantic candle night dinner everything is just perfect here from ambience to food to the service probably jehan numas most famous restaurant they serve quality indian food overall a nice family place very poor service and food taste is also not goodnot at all value for money will not recommend this place to anyone even a drink takes 10 mins to come so after so much of a hype about this restaurant i have finally visited this placeso this place is obviously have sophisticated and royal ambience to compliment there namethere is huge mango tree at the rooftop by which i guess this restaurant gets its name so staff is really good and very well informed service is real quick and impressivebrso i have tried hot and sour soup which was real good following by crispy corn which is of around 600 bucks but totally worth it the most disappointing is there kababs i have ordered a kabab platter to try all the varieties and i must tell all tastes real bad i dint like it at all after which i have tried noodles because of my love for chinese and it was okay it was not extraordinary but good to tastebrthis place is quite expensive and i do not complain about that because of the royalty of their name and they will treat you that way only very average food and service not worth a finedine experience this is the first impression this esteemed restaurant left on me unfortunately due to their lack of communication i had to leave the establishment without tasting their chefs creationsi had visited twice in the same day only to be turned away because they couldnt convey to us that the space is reserved very very peaceful place nicely maintained placefood is delicious but the major attraction is of ambiencelittle bit slow service but tolerablephirni was awesome in the desert went to the newly renovated place a big disappointment food took the longest time in coming and when it came it nalli niharihad a strand of hair in it unfortunately we were in the company of a bollywood director and this was embarrassing they repeated the order and the taste was good but i felt the whole atmosphere to be artificial in contrast to the earlier ambience the waiters were harried and inattentive not willing to go again in love with this place i can go there for breakfast and dinner at anytime apart from the complete menu baigan la bhartha is something you must order a fine example of luxury and fine dining is under the mango tree placed in the nook of jehan numa palace under the mango tree catches your eye with its cozy open ambience and warm lightingbrmenu is quite exclusive and if you feel cautious by fancy names dont be cause chances are itll be tasty at leastbra bit downside i felt was the quantity of orderbrotherwise under the mango tree is an experiencebrbrpersonal recommendation zafarni phirni its more than a hotel –under the mango tree is an experience i couldnt stop myself rating it 45 brbrexcept bar you have everything here that you usually get in an hotel perfect service and food quality ambience is way too good brhowever it opens after 7 pm onlybrbrfor 2 people it could cost you around 20002500 but definitely worth a visit my childhood memories last here a true luxury class place and food is delicious i cant write more because i would like recommend readers to visit this restaurant at jehan numa place bhopal and feel luxury and class by your self but do visit at night clam n peaceful place a perfect place for dinner with familythe food is extra tasty and quality of food is also nicethe service is also nicea perfect place overall i wonder how anyone should visit bhopal and not eat at under the mango tree at the jehan numa palace hotelbrbrsimply stunning food we started with black label whiskey on which they had one on one free with this we asked the server to serve us something quickly and came the hot pakodas and chicken malai tikka i swear it the taste was super awesome for both the malai tikka was just so soft and juicy not overtly spicy and had a cheesy tinge probably one of the best malai tikka i would have hadbrbrsine we had a flight to catch we asked for dal tadka baingan achari chicken curry along with rotis and rice each and everything was just so well made just lived the food here highly recommended must eat here for surebrbrthe nawabi food culture definitely exists here without a flinch simply superb a very fine dining place we had to wait for while before we got seated but the wait was well worth it we ordered kadhai paneer with naan and roti it was one of the best preparations of the dish ive ever had the breads were perfect too true mughlai cuisine indeed for dessert chana daal halwa is a must try but be prepared to wait as the food also takes a while to come out you can enjoy the beautiful ambience meanwhile why it is marked as pure veg the menu is full of nonvegetarian foodzomato is repeatedly doing mistakes in operating the pure veg filter an exotic place to dine in and host a party the ambience and food is superb starting with mouth watering achari paneer tikka and hara bhara kebabs along with fizzy nimbu pani topped with finely sliced sweet lime and shredded mint leaves mexican potato subz lucknowi dum biryani were outstanding the deserts are tasty but keep check on calories like baked boondi gulabjamun chocolate pastries and shahi tukda if you’re in bhopal then do not forget to visit this place it’s a beautiful place under a huge mango tree the ambience is superb with good vibes you can either sit on rooftop or on the ground floor but i’d suggest you to prefer rooftop if the weather allows 😅 talking about the food it was very well freshly cooked and very well presented i won’t say it is budget friendly but it’s completely worth itbrthe staff was friendly and courteous the restaurant is exactly like the name a gorgeous set up under the mango tree it’s so beautifully lit up at night and the food is just simply superb the achari mutton kebab platters are the best we’ve ever had brbrmoreover the hospitality was outstanding dol bahadur the manager made it so welcoming and adapted to our wants that we ended up eating here for two consecutive nights they decorated it beautifully for our anniversary as well abhishek was also an excellent server brbrthis place is a must visit if you’re in bhopal the perfect place food and ambience everything is top notch redvelvet cake and blueberry cheesecake here are to die for my go to place for birthday treats a delight to the taste buds paneer makhmali is a must try 😋 happy tummy brgreat quality food and friendly staff brlovely peaceful ambience a very peaceful place great food bukhara dal was not as good as we dilli walas are used to eating open kitchen gives a nice feel to guests they must introduce some soya chaap dishes too just had some kababs and drinks here kababs were great\\u200b and the whole concept of sitting on open roof under the mango tree is unique and refreshing this is my absolute favorite restaurant the food is always fantastic and no matter what i order i am always delighted with my meal servers are also great and always efficient happy and polite can’t wait to return and wouldn’t hesitate to recommend finest luxury restaurant in bhopal with world class food and service awesome place in love with the this place if you want to send some quality time with someone special

name jehnumain bhopal is meant to serve u delicious foodin best surrounded ambience the rennovated version of place and menu hits the iron rod and hence u donot regret paying here but yet i feel upset that i wasnot told about axis bank discount by the staff and neither was i offered one as i paid with axis bank debit card on the nite of 26 dec 2018 hence i ate up one star as that comes in

numa this restaurant was slightly underwhelming we had the amritsari fish and non veg platter but it was below our expectations although to be fair our expectations were pretty high however the service was 5 star and everything from how the waiters greet you to how the food is served was very welcoming good ambience “under the mango tree nice place for candle light dinner”brwe went to this restaurant which is actually a mix of different cuisines and types but i really liked their daal curry and baingain ki bhujiya along with some really good fries i recommend this place due to its economical rates to others vegetarians also very calmdont miss this one should you be around the chef has great magic wound which will make your wish come true people and staff are super cool to be honest in a fine dining restaurant i’ll hope to get freshly prepared food and nothing coming out of freezer and microwaved i got mutton briyani ice cold in the middle and then when i told the manager

stalebrspecially the chilly chicken was stinking i specifically said its for a patient hence do not to add spices but its too spicy grilled chicken in brown sauce with veggies was so tasty and a healthy dish too amazing food apne chef ko batao ki schezwan rice ka matlab thode se rice me 250 gram hari mirchi dalna nahi hota teast bhi hona chahiye crispy corn is not crispy packed hot fried corn very low quantity not at all fresh and tasteless a place with great view infront of bhopal upper lake that is the only plus point of this m p tourism driven restaurant as all other government restaurant and cafe this one also serves you the food with great pain they make you to starve for the food atleast for a heck of time food is good specifically nonveg so go for great view when you have much time to invest ✌ yesterday went to this place for hangout bcoz of nice weather really location is superb what a evening with family and friends food is good enjoyed a lot nice place with a nice view at nightbut service is somewhat sloworchestra also does not sing wellstill have a nice view with a cool breeze very bad service staff was very rude no management love this place for the view it has food os lovely too but the view is so scenic and beautiful just writing for the sake of word limit just writing for the sake of word limit situated at the hottest happening location of the city but what a big waste of space something better could have been set up over therebrwind n waves disappoints you everytime you visit it they lack taste in every single thing and on the top of it such heavy prices for this kind of food even pathetic would be a small word to describe it brthese people should probably either shut down the place after reading the reviews on zomato and could come up with something better and innovativebr highly overrated place only reason to be there is view of bhopal lake is picturesque i have been there quite few time but found it isnt value for money its quiet spacious place they have outdoor seating as well as insidethe view from roof is amazing to have some chitchat along with beer to enjoy the ambiencethey provide complimentary peanuts if you order alcohol which i loved the most dbeer choice were limited food was good in tasteoverall you can enjoy this place but just a suggestion there should be light music playing in background which will definitely double your mood we came here after listening lot s about thatbrbut honestly disappointingbrtables are vacant but we have to request for table as the server was not botheredbrafter making request we got the table in open roofbragain it takes a big time to let server came and took the orderbranythings good happned the taste of food was goodbrlove mutter mushroom currypaneer tikka dal tadkabrpoor service offered but love the view and ambiencebrdefinitely not come againbr this place was one of my best place to hang out with friends visited today after years lost the earlier charm degraded the food qualitybrthe staff have now worst customer interactions it has been a mixed kind of an experience the location view ambience is just perfect with the upper lake in front the food and drinks were nice but the service was too slow i am rating it just because of place overall it dont even deserve also they have worst service even taste was also not so good they just have location so yes if you want to chill yourself with location u may go there overall food and service is not upto the mark the roof top sitting offers you perfect lake view food is quite okay and even the service is satisfactory it would be better to avoid this place on weekends as the people keeps flooding in all in all it is a nice restaurant to visit nothing can beat the location while entering to the restaurant you will get stuck with the messes poor service low quality food but yeah off course best lake view 😅👎🏻 my fav place for hangout when in bhopal breathtaking view of lake hiltop restaurant and sumptuous food and drinks what else one need from life brthe time will pass like anything best place for retrospection awesome location bri used to go there quite often not for food but to enjoy world class scenic beauty of bhopal dinner with live orchestraperformance is a big plusbrfood is average in tastereasonably priced but little slow in service it is good for snacks and coffee some people are born with good looks but they spill beans as they open their mouth this place is best described in this sentencebrperfect location facing the lake serves good variety of veg non veg and drinks but then the dining experience is missing after all wind and waves is run by the govt not any private individual brservice is slow as a turtle i ordered for an extra naan during my dinner and it arrived after exact 20 mins waiters tend to forget your order and dont order chinese which surprisingly was sweet in tastebrthis place should not be your choice in case you are looking to eat but yes the location again wins this place is really boring and very bad in taste i tried various items but none of them were upto the markbrthe food was not fresh at allbri will not recommend this place at all 5 for just the view ample parking and the place gives a full view of the lake grest place to watch the sun go down the place is a must visit for those who wont crib about the food people who enjoy a good view with a beer mug or scotch glass in their hand also they serve quite a large tequila shot they serve food nothing to rave about family friends couples can all have a nice time decently priced ghatiya staff is too bad weve waited so long for our order but they didnt served us worst service ever never gonna visit the place again br ambience 75 because of good location best time is dinnerbrfood 60brservice 50brvalue for money 50brnothing exciting about this place other than the locationbrrecommended everything is equally good or bad order vegetarian food i don sometimes dont understand why all our mp tourism properties run in that sam e boring format with such a heavenly location such a massive space and such a courteous staff with so much of exoerience why do all our properties lack that finnese why dont we move away from that old ridiculous menu why dont we train our chefs and why cant we engineer the menu better one minus point for such a waste and laziness on our policy makers pointbr its amazing to have spent some quality time with someone food quality superb specially tandoor chinese food can plan for next visit soon i am giving it a three star only for the view of the lake food is below average with no value for money pricing is high overall its a one time try place drink and get out of here as long as you don’t eat you’ll be golden worst experience ever service was very late and staff was lost in their own things food quality was also very pathetic and tasted very bad hygiene was not at all maintained view was nice but the restaurant is not worth the veiw would never recommend this to anyone for the sake of their own health i love winds and waves because of the ambience and the view the vibe is awesome food is average ideal if you want to chill good service wind and waves waiter also good and food quality excellent and this hotel location front of lake is nice special variety food non veg i like butter chicken rogan josh nice and delicious food good for tea and coffee it does not have a good menu very poor service un professional sarkari staff from menu fish and chips rs 380brhakka veg noodles rs200brfresh lime soda rs 30bri liked the fish and chips it was perfectly fried crispy and veggies were perfectly sauted crispy fries i didnt feel veggies were bland unlike other place its a must try herebrveg hakka felt more like street food rather than restaurant style brfresh lime soda was perfectbrrecommend fish and chips and fresh lime soda brthey also serve alcoholbrambience 55bru cant miss lake side view awesome food awesome view go here if you want to enjoy your food in leisure with a nice view if you are in a hurry i wouldnt suggest this place we asked for ice water and was told we cant get it because the bar is closed as it is a dry day we were then told we could not have soft drinks because it was a dry day the staff does not seem to care and respond sarcastically back when asked basic questions terrible place would not recommend for anyone dont ask about the food because we didnt care enough to get to it not worth wasting my time and money here if you happen to be in bhopal or have staying in bhopal and having ample time do not miss visiting this place for its location if you are sitting on its upper deck you get a magnificent view with 180 degrees view of the lake a place where you can sit back and relax with some drinks and food what we had was beer and french fries during our visit there last month during the same trip we ordered some cold coffee and didnt had any other food but we loved the ambience and the courteous service a place highly recommended to be visited either with your friends and family this is beautiful place with a majestic view of the lake perfect to chill out i have been there are couple times in the morning and evening and both times i felt a different charm of this place we stayed here as hotel guests and while the hotel is good the food is so so so bad the view is the only factor to dine in here but the food is borderline inedible being served at premium prices dahi ke kebab had no dahi served with a weird green dip the spring roll one giant dough layer filled with raw ish veggies disgusting noodles were mushy overcooked the vegetables undercooked the sauce was just plain bad do not recommend dining here arrogant and rude staff they wont treat you like guests illiterate and uncivilized specially siddhiqui and waiter named sanotsh consider it a last option to visit with family governments ought to run administration not hotels this place is a testimony to this adage what a beautiful located place being destroyed by sarkari prashashan food is bad service even worse waiters act as if they are obliging you come here only if you want to have a birds eye view of our beautiful lake beautiful location quite serene and peaceful good place to hangout on an evening beside the lake good coffee and snacks the view is making up for the place more than the food but its not to be missed when in bhopal service is poor 💩 nothing good about it only they have one natural view the food was never good and personally i wont suggest the place to any one but if you are a couple and looking a place to sit and have 200300 in pocket you can sure try this cafe i have always felt that the restaurants by mptdc are above average but was always hesitant to come to this place after seeing the adverse reviews on foodbrtoday i was there with a group of friends for a longer session over snacks n tea my observationbr1 the place is appreciated for its view we were not so fortunate as the green trees all around except the restaurants own garden were dry due to summer so not restaurants fault it was compensated by the bful sunset view when we were leavingbr2 the staff was cooperative n helpful but not very agilebr3 washrooms need some better maintenance with proper tissuehand wipes supplybr4 we ordered paneer pakodas veg spring rolls veg hakka chow veg manchurian and tea each item was perfectly made and excellent in tastebrnice experience rating 45br wind and waves is a waste of location dy dnt have service nor taste nor quality dy r jst earning of wat left is of location dy have pls make gud utilisation of dis brailiant location such a shame bad service and really bad attitude towards customers brhoping thus place improves in this century brthe only thing good is the viewbr veiw is the best and food is so delicious and the service is superb than other restaurant and fully lake facing rooms that provide amazing lake view from inside of rooms giving 2 stars just for the location the view is beautiful and thats to it to this place food is pathetic almost like roadside food and very expensive give it a mise unless u r dying of hunger remember the song from aarakshanjhatak kar zulf such an awesome location that it came in the eyes of bollywood directors dbrthose white chairs and the lake view is more than enough to make your evenings in bhopal pleasant i wish they were equally awesome in their preperations but they are certainly not unpalatable they are overpriced but the food is avg to good bri would recommend it for eveningshave a coffee cutlets or some other snacks with friends a nice place for romantic dates if you want to have dinnergo for better places which give you value for money

are deceptivebrlocation best in the citybrreach approachable from every partbrtime 11 11brfood brservice bri have attended a lot of parties organised at winds and waves and there has been a consistentcy in one or the other complaint with regard to foodbrthe last time i saw people in waiting was during the tourism day when it offered 50 off on foodbrif you really want to go dinner is most suitable not only the place has the best view in the city infront of the lake and gleaming lights of the vehicals passing over the vip road the scenic beauty is accompanied by cool water body breeze at night it also has live performances by some upcoming artists who are pretty goodbrhowever my main concern is regarding the food honestly i never liked any soup be it clear or manchow or cream or even tomato or veg or nonveg my tastebuds never allowed me to take another gulp apart from understanding the flavour of what actually has been servedbrstarters are average chinese is average indian is average vegetarian main course is little below average non vegetarian main course is average only thing i really loved were the fish fingers which were close to what i had at jehan numa and lake view ashokabrits disheartening that the beautiful location cannot offer equally beautiful in taste ofcourse food points for location and starry night extremely hyped up place service neutral food good ambience good only because of its locationbrnot fit for a blowout coz bar prices are quite fancybrwill leave you thinking why prices are exaggerated this restaurant is owned and run by mptourism the location is one of the best in the world many bollywood movies have been shot here the restaurant is multilevel indoor and outdoor sitting overseeing the upper lake bhopal the food is one of the best i have had anywhere in the world trust me if you are a visitor to bhopal dont miss it the view is breathtaking day and night and the outdoor seating is a major plus a thumbsup for that the music arrangements can be better food is mediocre as is the service good for an evening in lovely weather located near the upper lake and you get a great view of lake from this restaurant been to this restaurant a couple times now and just loved the overall feel to have drinks and dine herebrbrthe food here is just about average and the portions are also decent enough what excels out at this place is the overall feel as you have beautiful lake on the front and the experience is beautiful if you visit here on eveningbrbrthe place gets quite crowded in the weekends and everyone wishes to get the table at the corners so they can get that beautiful view the service however is bad here the staff is least bothered about your seating they sometimes have the live music alsobrbrwould recommended to everyone looking out for the barrestaurant in open terrace area specially for drinks as the food is just average here cheers not quality service you can enjoy the view but not the service food is okay okay you wont feel the money worth sunset is the perfect time to go if wish to go herebrbr i have been to this place many tymsthis is all tym fav n the biggest yes is its location one of the best

place probably in mp that have such a great location the view here is just amazing and you feel like a god when you are here the management team is great manager waiter they tell you what to have their special and they are too good and sweet and probably one of the greatest management team in bhopal brkudos to wind and waves and their team and please keep up the good workbr cant understand the rating extremely delicious north indian food in one of premier locales of bhopal just in front of the main lake reasonably priced despite being a govt hotel the friendly servers were ready to serve us lunch anywhere whether outside in the balcony inside the bar or the airconditioned restaurant downstairs liked the place worst food everbri havent had such bad food in ages the only saving grace is the lake side view the service was fine mosquitoes during the evening will ruin the view and i see no point going anyother time its better to sit inside its quite costly aswell i highly recommend not dinning there except for a superb location the place can just be called real average food quality isnt very great chilly paneer appeared stale black coffee is a safe bet which cannot be judged cold coffee looked average as well the place is just calm quiet n serene to b at a must visit place beautiful location good services and ample quantity of food as per the rates complimented with melodious live musical performances and lake view perfect for dates great ambience beautiful view of upper lake and provides both indoor and outdoor seating been there 23 times and service was always great but the food is average and could be improved overall a nice and peaceful place except for the amazing location offering great vistas of the lake nothing else is good at winds and waves one can go here to spend time at wonderful location over a cup of chai but the idea of ordering even potato wedges is a waste of money i been to this place awesome location and the ambience is amazing the view of lake is picturesque the restaurant ambience also goodbrbrservice the hospitality is poor the waiters are not upto mark and lack proper training the service was overall is thumbs down considering the price the hospitality is poorbrbrfood the taste is not very exclusive i had fried rice and manchurian which i found below expectation the rice was of an average quality and while eating i found the vegetables not cooked properly though the manchurian was ok the manchurian gravy could have been a lot better and lack some key ingredient especially garlicbrbroverall i think people come here because of the view the restaurant serve to its customer need to improve the food may be the head chef team needs few more additionbrbr ambiance 55brfood 25brbooze 25 no varieties availablebrservice 15 as

kill before my flight the outdoor seating area provides a mesmerising view of the lake had ordered masala peanuts which were decent and some sort of boiled chana chaat which was quite tough to push down my winds nd waves the restraunt not the drinks section abovebrgoods location rather d view is probably d best in bhopal u have d upper lake just in front of u ambience inside is okk coz mostly u wud wanna sit outside nd dey kno dat nd yeah d service is pretty good food is okk read belowbrbrnot so good in nights its not convenient to sit outside no proper arrangement no lights bugs etc food is good but heavy scope for improvement still said good coz ppl visit such places for ambience nd location the lake side restaurant owned by the government is a must visit restro when coming near the lake the parking space was a problem but the live music and beautiful lake side view compensated for it the service was way too slow fantastic view food was okayish and staff was friendly too prices were not that expensive if you see the location of the restaurant best place to have a beer with breathtaking view of beautiful bhopal didnt like the food or the ambience the service is okayish 5 for the service and 1 for the view outside i ordered butter naan and tadkewali dal and some paneer dish overall its okayish the only good thing about the place is the lake view the food is bad the quality of food is really bad i wont reccomend this place to anyone not even my enemiesits that bad this is an exotic place especially because of its location and serenity i have been to thi place number of times and have fallen head over heels each time the snacks re tasty and its overall a lovable place to spend time with your gang of friends i dont think any body comes here for food this place commands a magnificent view of the lake evenings are amazing to sit and watch sunsets over a mug of beer and some live music they have done a machaan type of place from where the live music can happen coming to food it was ordinary we ordered the safest butter chicken that cant be screwed easily the mava baati deserves a mention i guess this was the bhopal speciality item in the menu place with a view of a beautiful lake this place is located on the top of the hill and one can have a better view from therebrbri got this opportunity to visit this place along with my international friends the place was decent and the ambience was nice quality of the food was not up to the mark though prices are competitivebrbranother thing that attracted me was live music one can have a wonderful time with live music and sometimes gazalbrbroverall this is a good place to visit once with your friends to have a beautiful view of lake especially at evening timebrbrambience 3brfood 2brservice 2brbrplease note that you need to change your menu food alcohol as i found it outdated need more offers on this restaurant rated 30 and that is only because of the location of this restaurant it feels great here as soon as you arrive here but dont expect the same for the food people who come here generally are those who just want to relax in the windy environment facing towards the lake and their drinks in handbrthe food here is not as tempting and the menu is also not that special just the regular bites of the north indian cuisine is served here it is a total injustice to this prime location in entire bhopalbrinstead go visit a cafe coffee day outlet just adjacent to this place and enjoy your evening with a coffee and share some light moments food 155brvalue for money 15brservice 15 pitiable brlocation and view 455brbroverall 25brbrso ultimatly only location is the thing which you will appreciate here i wish they would do justice to the location one of the most beautiful spots in the city perfect place to have a friends outing or a romantic date or great family timebrbut the food if they do read these reviews i personally want to request them to please improve the quality of foodbrthey have live music sometimes in the eveningbrit could turn into the most happening place if only they pay attention to the basics this place is a sight for the eyes and its a bliss drinking and eating while watching the sunset amidst the spectacular lakeview perfect for date meeting dining in or for a casual outing they have a licensed bar so you can even have beer vodka wine or whatever you prefer i had chinese food which was good in taste but the place is losing its charm for some reasons lately and i feel it is taken less care ofbralso the french fries i had werent freshly prepared and it seemed like the kept over fries were deep fried again and served improvement in the menu could be made since it look outdated now although the prices are competitive well obrwould start with this a cup of coffee with some snack n beautiful peaceful eve in bhopal this place enjoys one of the best locations in the city overlooking the beautiful badi jheel the place has good ambience but has lots of room for improvement brthe food is tad bit disappointing with limited choices available in fact the location gives an edge to the restaurant to develop into a fine dining place i hope i can see improvement next time a place with a view service is a bit slow but rates are competitive snacks are quite decent waiters will keep bothering you if you will not continuously order something overall a nice place to drink and relax with the view of bada zheel this place ❣️brbeen here quite a few times the place has never been disappointing brambience brthe location of the place says it all the view of the lake is just what you need while enjoying your drink n food bra visit in the eveningnight is a different experience altogether with shining bhopal its water reflection and background musicbrfoodbrin the bar restaurant they offer crisp n limited food items no wasting time on selecting food itembrthere are tandoor n non tandoor items which is offered at different times of the day to enjoy with your drink chilli paneer manchurian chicken tikka banjara chicken and hara bhara kabab are worth trying with different cocktails and mocktails brservicebrone can expect a great service this is not to be worried about food is served in no time except for the tandoor items which is quite obvious having both indoor and outdoor seating it can accommodate a number of guests brbri feel its perfect for dinner dates and any kind of party do visit once and then keep visiting nice ambience and live music create s magic with seene view of upper lake you can get both outdoor and indoor tablesbrfood is and service is ok but the price looks a bit higher for the food served this place was once my favourite however it has lost its charm over the periodbrbrlocation is beautiful and u can sit and njoi the view of lake live music plays over here which adds to the ambience brbrindoor seating is also available however i prefer the outdoor seatingbrbrchairs aren’t comfortable and do not have cushions which can be painful if u intend to sit for a long time brbrfood and service has degraded a lot and it’s pathetic now be it starter mock tails or main course none of them is worth ur money service is slow brbranother challenge is the hygiene couple of times i have found dirty plates here and u can spot roaches and rodents roaming around the tables brbrall marks i have given is for location only place is beautiful but staff need to be trained place lacks hospitality they serve complementry peanuts with drinks which are not eatable as they are too much oilybrfish fingers were yummy overall awesome place for evenings but lacks hospitality although its situated at one of the most scenic location but food and service is pathetic ordered paneer pakoda once to enjoy it in a rainy season it was horrible overcooked and soaked completely in oil if one want to have his meal infront of lake then they must go their good place 😍😍 great food especially nonveg chilli chicken was yumm 😍😍😍😍😍brperfect place for reunion 👍👍 the place is well known in bhopal not for the food but for the amazing view of the upper lake i had a visit to this place on the occasion of my friends birthday the food is good but the service is poorbrwhenever you visit this place try to get a table in the open br excellent placei mean outstandingits got everything u needawesome place for couples for a nice date a bit on the cosy side but affordablemust a once a visit place this place deserves an extra point just for the exquisite view the upper lake in all its glory right there in front of you the live music adds to the charm food is fine not outstanding but this place is definitely worth a visit to experience the city of lakes beautiful view and a superb place to just chill this is probably the best located place to have a drink or 2 and to have some tasty snacks not giving a complete 5 cause the food was a little sweet amazing place though for foodies this is definitely not the place we did this mistake by ordering chinese from the menu loads of oil is what was consistent in each dish with the chilly chicken being just ok rest not even worth a mention so if you are looking for a great lake view and want to enjoy the evening with friends and family minus some hardcore eating then visit this place hard drinks are available and the best eatable with it will be the cheese and pineapple canapes probably you can give the indian fare a try but that too at your own risk beautiful view of the lake from a height on the hill quite a laid back atmosphere where waiters dont bother you too much food was fresh and well made quite surprising that this has such a low rating was hesitant to go here due to this but good that i finally decided to visit ideal place to have dinner after a lovely boat ride on the adjoining lake we were recommended this place by a relative because of good food quality and ambience we were totally satisfied with the food taste and quality and the amazing lake view but the service is very poor we had to wait several minutes to even receive a menu the reception was very poor by the waiters and even after raising our hand to order the waiters went off without acknowledging we were asked to hurry with our lunch menu by informing us that the kitchen is closing but i was pretty sure the kitchen was not closing but they just need to go down the stairs would definitely not recommend this place for anyone who wants to have a decent experience very disappointed with the service and staff behaviour first of the ambience steal the show here people visit for lake view retreat and it give justice to that servicing is average and the food we ordered was not hot even prices are high but taste is not must savoury veg kebabs are good and spring rolls are not properly cooked though we ordered anything else after that yes for private meetings its good it was located near upper lake in bhopal you will get nice view of lake bhopal from the restaurant top floor taste was no so good you can visit this place to experience the view from top a decent place to spend a peaceful evening not on weekends i am writing this review after several visits read above 30 in last few yearsbrbrthey have both indoor and outdoor seating arrangements with beautiful lake view outdoor seatingbrbra brief reviewbrambience 910 if you have favourable climate

places location is beautiful and this place is my favorite for hangout with friends lake view with seating both inside and outside food quality is average and service is ok the scenic view from this place is breathtaking there is a beautiful view of lake food is also great i orderd veg kothe and veg spring roll they were finger licking good the best part is the ambience if you want a peaceful dinner this place is the best option we went there amidst the rains and clouds and this place was like heaven we chose the outside seating considering the weather and it was simply superb the staff is courteous and service is also good we took chilled beers fish fingers and chilli chicken the food was also good the starters were crispy and cooked well peanuts were served complimentary the place is nice and is recommended winds n wavesbrprobably the best location of bhopal with worst foodbrservice was pathetic not worthy of a review when it comes to foodbrdisappointed✖️ they r making u fool by adding extra charges for itbrgiving you fake bill and take extra charges went to this place on recommendation of mp tourism department we ordered malai kofta and garlic nan along with veg cutlets however place is packed because of its lake view but it failed to deliver the food on taste and qualitybrthe koftas were terrible to say the least the place is a big no for dining if possible go here only for snacks and drinks superb ambiance live music is cherry on the cake especially when weather is nice great place to spend time with close friends and familybrbrhowever the food is a big let downalso the prices are way high when compared to the taste quality and quantitybr3 stars only for the setup if there was an award to be handed out to restaurant only on the basis of location wind n waves would get that one for sure in the city of bhopal but they seriously need to improve a lot in terms of their food and service there service is damn slow and food is just above average in taste according to me some restraunts like baapu ki kutia in mp nagar or vrindavan dhaba serves better food at much cheaper rates than this mediocre place 25 stars only for the scenic view and the feeling it gave me while having average food one of the best foodie restaurant in bhopalthe view from restaurant is awesomethe food is awesomespecially veg kothefish tikkatandoori chicken everytime i visit bhopal this place is in the top of my listmust visit after 7 pm you will love it kay so this place have always been in the list of a bhopal visitor or bhopali all because of our very own lake 😊 and the mesmerising view its the usp of this placebrthis is operated by state tourism department so the standard and quality are below norms not even h of hospitality so please dont go with the expectationsbrthe dishes arent going to please you they are all okayishbrso why visit there when the food isnt good and service is next to nilbrthe answer is the view its totally worth itbrand if you consume alcoholthey have a bar on the first floorbrthat will be one of the most satisfying booze you will ever have even if you dont have companybrin the monsoons this place gets amazingbrvery romantic if you are on a date ps again food will disappointbrin the summers though please prefer indoor sitings the only exoticness this place holds is the view it providesbrthe taste is not bad at all but the food is unreasonably expensivebreveryone says the service is slow but of course in a place like this you wouldnt want to just get everything fast and then leave this is where youd want to sit relax and enjoy the viewbrsave for their prices this could really be a good place the restaurant is very popular because of the lovely view of lake where u will definitely get to feel winds and view of waves brvisited many time before last visited on 1012018 the restaurant was crowded as it was new year the food is decent with decent price brabout the taste not mouthwatering but can satisfy your taste budbrservice excellent 55 if you know how to treat the waiters broverall must visit place for if u are bhopalior living in bhopal has nothing to offer except the view of the lake typical sarkaari service arrogant slow tardy needlessly expensive rates for such mediocre food best avoided the rating is only for the lake view else the food is just ok the worst thing is they wont have stock of common alcohol when we visited this place they have only kingfisher strong in beer and nothing else also after serving one large peg of black dog they simply said sir wo to khtam ho gyi koi aur dekhlo warna beer pilo who says like thisbrbrthe ambiance was also ok ok types they seriously need to improve the quality it wasnt even a worthwhile experience this restaurant is mp tourism owned which explains why granted its at a picturesque location but everything else from food serving staff ambience even the furniture stinks big time i was apalled to find plastic chairs inside the restaurant the whole restaurant bore the look of a second grade banquet hall food uh horrendous waiters have government job so they were least bothered about promptness or even using serving trays and its costly burns a hole in your heart to be honest lol if you still want to eat out here id suggest go for dinner during lunchtime youll be more focused at waves of garbage in upper lake 15 stars because atleast we got free parking p i see a lot of people commenting on the deteriorating quality of food but let me be honest there are quite a few items which taste good when compared to other places the usps of this place are the location ambiance and service i visit this place nearly 24 times a year since 2010 and i have enjoyed my each visit to the place i agree there are times when the service is really slow but the place gets crowded quickly too brfor me this is one of the must visit places in bhopal after top n town icecreams the place is so beautiful you visit there enjoy the beauty look at menu quite high price still you want to give a try you order coffee sandwiches chhole kulcha when i visited there it was on menu as wind and waves special and few more starters wait for eternity to get it served and when you have the first bite you regret taking right turn not left brbryou actually do this several times hoping for some improvement but only improvement you find is in the scenary well there was improvement in service when i last visited therebrbrgiving 2 for location 1 for chhola kulcha which were actually good could be accidentally but yes they were good in quantity as well as tastebrbrwhat a good bar can do for teetotaller nothing location of the restaurant what should i say the best location in city to have a perfect dine service is good and its quite really fast the taste is excellent we had chicken tikka which was very good some famous liquor brands are here with a live musical performance and rate of are also also not high i recommend all of you to give a try over there who has has not tasted fb of there its definitely only the lake view which drags you heredefinitely awesomest location in the citybrbut all is just when you get a place cause its generally occupied otherwise theres no special factor in the ambience if you sit inside bri wish i could have written the same way about food also unfortunately service is actually bad i had to get up and askto place the order many timesyaa the starters were goodand the rest of the food was okaybrdefinitely do visit for the location brif they improve upon food it can definitely be my first choice they have somehow managed to destroy probably the best location for any restaurant in madhya pradesh the food is pathetic staff is sarkari level rude and can someone please stop the live music there we have some good memories of wind and waves from way back in 200812 it used to be one of the best restaurants in bhopal gradually the restaurant has degraded to ordinary and then pathetic now even the best view can not compensate for really bad service and poor food sadly people will keep going there and keep on being disappointed such a waste of the most beautiful property in probably our country br definitely worth sitting outside and on upper deck lovely view of the lake and city at night downside is thats where the smokers additionally sit accommodation was slow and churlish aliment was decent and menu is extensive price is plausible given the view best place to be visited when its raining the view of lake from its windows also becomes a part of your meal very romantic ambience food is good specially the banana berry ripple its very tempting from its presentation if you have its 1 bite then you cant stop you will be lost in its mouth relishing taste hugely disappointed pathetic service have to wait a lot to get my order only ambience is good and nothing elseone star only for ambience pathetic worst service and behaviourbrwent there on a evening to have dinner the manager was utterly rude and toxic ordered a beer and it took 30 mins asked the manager and he responded humare paas bohot waiting hai aapko pata nahi hai line mai lagna padhta hai waiters ko blah blah blah the waiter was roaming around we went without taking their service perfect evening ruined i went on official dinner at wind and waves this place has beautiful city and lake view this place has cozy romantic wibe outside seating is amazing brbrthis place has ample seating but it stays crowded during weekends would recommend to visit evening on weekdays brbrfood was good nothing extraordinary we had cream of mushroom soup spring rolls panner kabab paneer kadhai rice and daal service is ok staff is polite price is reasonable brbrone should visit this place for amazing view many bollywood movie scenes has shot here it seems the view form this place is the only thing that keep it open till date now i know providing a livelihood to people is a good thing but the live singing ruins the mood to eatbrthe food is not upto the location settingbrlove the play of levels though this palace should be a modified into a coffee or hangout destination because location is the only saviour the food not even low in variety but also poor in taste though the ripples and soothing waves will calm your anger must to mention the lake view is amazing and one can enjoy drinks over here with all the requirements for a hangover😂😉 stunning view coupled with amazing food and prompt service makes this restaurant one to revisit comfortable metal chairs with the sun falling on our shoulders made for a warm and inviting ambience brwe had ordered mutton biryani tandoori roti bhuna gosht and sweet lime sodas the biryani though not the best ive had was quite good and was served in an adequate amount the bhuna gosht an afghani styled mutton dish prepared in the hydrabadi style was fingerlicking good the lime sodas however were a bit on the sweeter end of the spectrum opposed to my preference of a more balanced taste but thats just me being a nitpicker brits definitely a personal suggestion of mine the only good thing about this place is its location and no other restaurant in bhopal can beat that bt that is it everything else was a complete let down food took years to reach to our table and it tasted not as good as it should have been considering the premium price on talking to their not so friendly staff i came to know that this restaurant is managed by mp tourism and then felt even worse about the quality this place has the most potential to become the best in the city with all the resources too in hand but still it is this bad all stars are just for the lake view pure picturesque place amazing feelsbrfood is overratedbrhad fried ricebrdaal and naanbrthey were too average cake delivery in this condition thats not acceptable worst experience hey there bri hoped you found this understandingbrbrthe truffle one was good but the mango swiss roll was not since the truffle was good i believe you have the potential and could have done better with the swiss roll too bri strongly suggest you should either increase the quality of the roll and price along with it andor remove it from the menu if you cant increase the qualitybrbrsorry to be blunt but the point is you are degrading the quality just to keep the prices intact even though you could have prepared it much better as i could understand from the truffle brbrkeep up the spirit and passion of serving the best possible br love d cake thnx a lot winni cakes for make my daughter bday spl pizza was not at all good even the oregano was of poor quality spinach quantity very small so little more quantity the size is too small there was a cherry or strawberry taste in black forest pastry cheese

hakka noodles an finger chips they send me small portion hakka noodles an worst french fries an small portion of manchurian in spilled packaging worst packaging worst delivery experience very less portion size bekaar hai kabhi mat order krnaa iss restaurant se ghatiyaa worst experience ever ordered chicken fried momos and some pieces were raw and some were burnt wanted to throw this order at their face pathetic grt taste the food was very bad and i didnt liked there tikka which they said its there speciality it was very hard and felt it was old and chicken curry they gave was full of bones and even same they did in tikka by giving bones only mostly so they can save money and in zomato its written buffet but they were not serving buffet in zomato descount so its very wrong and very bad experience butter roghni naan ki jaga tandoori roti bheji apne tasteless biryani soup is not gud and also chicken noodles is very spicy and noodles is oily tikka was undercooked the worst biryani i ever had mix of weird rice and chicken very pathetic food your item was not packed with seal brthe fries look stale this isn’t the zauq food i expected the food was good but the service was surprisingly inhospitable we were told right at the beginning that we couldnt be accommodated despite having a reservation there is no momos packaging is also not good the quantity was not good brand the taste was very badbrtemperature was low brtotally bad i want my refund the rice was uncooked bad food more like chicken fried rice also cheap rice quality poor very little wrong item was sent quantity was less zauq ka staff bahut he zyada battamiz hai na he customer se baat karne ki tamiz hai na he khana serve karne ki khas kar inke staff mein ek lady waiter hai uska naam arshi aur uski sister ye dono itni zyada battamiz hai ki main jab jab family ko le kar gaya ulta mujhe he bezzat kiya gaya aisa lagta hai jaise hum free me khana kha rahe hai tunday kebabs were not at all soft like before barra was burnt completely all it had burnt charcoaling taste very disappointed as i always loved zauq food gravy ka test bahut bura tha chicken pieces bhi nahin the sirf bones thi very unprofessional and rude behaviour i dont like itfood is ok ok not so good bad chicken curry and paneer tikka so bad they taste like a shitso i dont recommend any one else the portion size of chilli potatoes was way small compared to what i had ordered before from here only the description for chilli potatoes and momos combo says that there will be 4 momos but only received 3 although chilli potatoes were good in taste the fried rice were very bland and so were masala fries which didnt even have a pinch of salt had better experience of ordering before but this time was a total waste of money \\ufeffi had a buffet dinner with my friends and left highly disappointed the staff was unprofessional and rudethe food tasted very poor and low quality i would not recommend this place to anybody because it is just a waste of money good absolutely tasteless and to top it i found an insect at the end of it ewwww i think i ate food with god knows what all insects inside it seekh kababs meat was clearly spoilt they used the mixture of some other type of kabab and formed a cylindrical shape because they definitely werent even close to what seekh kabas are like taste wise it was good but the portion size was pathetic for the so called biryani such a disappointment money waste restaurant i ordered mutton tunday kebab and they were the worst i could ever imagine they gave me food poisoning too fantastic taste worst food ever the quality of mutton was very bad smelly mutton very bad it was yummy great work zauq keep it up👍🏻 great taste worst taste dont try it ever one of my item was missing in the order and still no refund restaurant not replying never ordering again one of worst biryanis i’ve ever eaten feels uncooked very bad taste biryani was ok half of chicken pieces are waste bri think they need to change their title from boneless to meatless 😂 so idiotic taste kadhai chicken was very bad roti was good worst experience poor food quality less porgion size worst food i west of my money amezing food the salad was very spicy it was all soggy and not at all tasty basically a disappointment soup is completely tasteless the dish was extremely disappointing the dish had sour curd which made the dish extremely weird in taste and i hope this doesnt happen again sada hua he smell arhi he bhooke ka mar jayenge lekin zauq se kabhi khana nahi bulwayenge bahot hi takleef de tajurba raha zauq ke khane ka apne khanasama se kahiye warqi bread ka matlab bhi jaane aur bana bhi seekhensirf ghee main adhkachha paratha tal dene ko warqui paratha nahi kehte aur nilofer seekh kebab ki jagah jo chicken shami kebab the woh bhi freez kiye hue adh kachhe kebab rahe humare mitr ne kaha zauq se bulawao khana aur ab woh bechara ghar se banwa kar laa raha hai bad quality food soggy i hate it mixed two items and make it biryani i tasted wrost biryani ever from this hotel zeera rice was for name sake only few zeera granules were sprinkled on plain rice quantity also very less chicken tandoori also sub standard poor quality food smell weird quality of food was very poor no trast i order egg curry from this restaurant but it was verry poor in taste fresh nahi tha wapas mangwa len the best qorma you can find in bhopal very bad jst like boil rice tasteless biryani awesome food food was terrible we order chicken kadhai which tasted awful and had excess of oil and was not even fresh very good experience i ordered combo of veg fried with 4 piece of steam momos masala fried fries but instead of momos i got manchurian i want refund very tastey food mutton quality not good if possible so please improve this average expectations were high but not upto the mark the taste was just okay not satisfied dirty food nihari ke liye koi special cook rakhne i have recieved the wrong item again this time i am very unhappy with the experience with zomato even after providing cooking instructions to make it less spicy it was still very hot i am not at all satisfied we went for dinner buffet yesterday and the dishes were empty no salad was refilledbrand no hygiene and cleanlinessbrvery badly disappointed floor was dirty near the dining area and near the food cornerbrno one pay attention towards the service and qualitybrnot worth at all i am a vegetarian and paid without eatingbras no food was there please do not send wrong items worst delivery experience excellent taste anytime go for itbrdidnt even get time to click a picture i wish the sheermaals were not sliced i love the taste bahut hi ganda test tha paise barbad karna hai kyunki khana bhi kaccha tha khane mein test jaisi koi chij hi nahin thi pathetic place at a superb location the worst double fried previous day cooked not expected totally disappointed no salads no proper packaging and mainly not a good taste br account to the price portion was not enough just one piece and one bone in biryani the boneless murgh musallam lababdar was very bad it had no taste at all i do not recommend it to anyone not good worst experience this is the quantity of their biryani combo with raita that cost 165 rs too less portion and their was no taste in rice first learn making biryani then sell it with the name of biryani will never order from this low quality restaurant ever received only 2 itna kharab test or khana thanda or quantity itni kam or jo bola wo bhi nhi diya brworst west of money and taking too much time for delivery waste of money the only vegetable they added in salad is capsicum and hardly 10grams of onion and chicken is not more than 50 grams taste is also not good ita just boiled chicken with capsicum the food i received was definitely not pasanda it was more of a mutton stew instead authentic taste but one of my ordered item nachos had missing sunny side up which was mentioned in the item description rest all was fine brbao was the best itembrfood is good taste is good and packing is also fine good authentic pan asian outlet recommend absolutely enjoyed the sushis very very oily tasteless and like a road side food big disappointment finally a very good sushi place in bhopal ordered prawn tempura avocado sushi both were really really good however i went around 10 pm they were out of salmon so many be that is an area of improvement otherwise everything was really nice poor packaging half of the soup i ordered leaked tried edamame asparagus tempura chicken bacon and pad thai excelled taste great sushi amazing food owsm food zoku dimsum platter is overpriced and not very great other wise food is good and authentic indo chinese premium taste taste was good but the package could not hold ramen well it was all wet when the recieved the package also the quantity was quite less compared to the price charged for the item sushi and dimsums are good one of the better places in bhopal ramen is below average the rest of the food is average go there just for the sushi roof is leaking food is average they dont accept payments from zomato so they have just listed themselves but dont accept payment from zomato soups were very delicious but the starters and the main course was average in taste soooooo delicious service decor food everything is a 10 the food is quite good but the staff and services degrade the taste of it found very arrogant staff even after paying through zomato they kept on insisting for paying the discounted amount and were just not polite they made me pay the amount that was discounted making the experience very horrible spicy baby potato was sweet and not spicy at all brchilli oil garlic noodle did not have enough chilli oil and was similar to a street side noodles not worth the price the service is very pathetic they take more than 1 hour to serve food after the order has been placed very bad service brand the food is also not that great '"
