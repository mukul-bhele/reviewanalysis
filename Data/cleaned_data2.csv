evening on picking me up he had offered a few options for the venue but jehan numa palace won hands down for its quality of food as we had experienced in our previous dinner five years ago in a not so agreeable climate of early june we had navigated through an erratic traffic of the city and on reaching the hotel premises handed the car keys to the valet parking attendant toying with the choices of indian versus continental food the latter had weighed heavier and we proceeded to ‚Äòla kuchina‚Äô a fine dining outlet for italian and other mediterranean cuisines brbrmy friend was ushered in with warm greetings by the manager and wait staffs as an acknowledgement of his frequent visits we settled down comfortably on a corner table within a largish dining space still quite empty at 830 pm the

resplendent d√©cor muted lighting and heavy drapery all contributed in crafting an ambiance rich with legacy brbrthe ma√Ætre d‚Äô while noting our preferences politely suggested the items for catering to our tastes better for our choice of drinks i went for smirnoff with lime cordial soda my friend opted for the scotch black white with soda we asked for ‚Äòprawns cocktail‚Äô as the starter and one portion of the soup ‚Äòchicken ginger broth‚Äô to be shared by two of us the salad came with a good number of ‚Äòtail on‚Äô medium sized prawns and the soup tasted simply excellent with an exuding aroma for the main courses we chose ‚Äòchicken saganaki‚Äô with tzatziki sauce and ‚Äòsouthern fried chicken with saut√©ed vegetables‚Äô saganaki a rich tomatoey and typically greek preparation was served in a large quantity with chunks of chicken tzatziki sauce another mediterranean speciality prepared with strained yoghurt with cucumber garlic salt and olive oil has been extensively used for meat dishes and also as dip for the meats the dish while looking very healthy tasted a bit bland for our palates southern fried chicken came in the form of not so thick pan fried and thinly crusted boneless chicken fillets served with the plentiful of fried potato and saut√©ed broccoli beans etc we came back quite satiated promising to return in the near future to enhance our gastronomical

la kuchina remains closed like its hiding a wonderful secret inside and it really is a wonderful little space with an open kitchen and amazing hospitalitybrbrluxurious and high end from the food to the decor this place oozes sophistication and i hate to admit it but i tend to spend an extra half hour getting dressed if i know i am headed there for the nightbrso a favourite visited from the land of sheikssands and oil and we ended up at our yearly ritual girls night spot for some downtimebrbrla kuchina has a lovely drinks menu with a good wine list which we skipped on this particular nightbrthe food menu is italian heaven and one can compare the variety and taste to any high end italian restaurant in any of the big citiesbrbrwe walked into an almost empty room that was buzzing with energy from the kitchen and found our favourite corner spot to settle down at what i love about such places is that you dont have to worry about loud music or too many people and can kick back and have a real conversationbrbrwhat we orderedbr1 tomato and basil soup brcame in the prettiest bowls along with a platter of breads and tasted perfect tangy and creamy and warm was exactly what we needed in this weather and the undertones of basil in every spoonful was simply perfectbr2 whole wheat penne in pink alfredo sauce with chickena first time orderbrthe penne was perfectly cooked or should i say perfectly al dente the pink alfredo sauce well i could have bowls full of just the sauce for dinner and be completely satisfied the best pink sauce i have ever had the chicken was cut into bite sized pieces and cooked on point it wasnt as spicy as i would have liked but then a little chilli flakes fixed it for me and my friend who isnt a spicy food fan had nothing to complain aboutbrthe only thing i could nitpick about is that the pasta used wasnt all whole wheat only we definitely found a few not wheat penne pieces in our pasta but since we were enjoying our meal we chose not to complain about itbrbrthe meal was perfect the company even better and it was just a lovely night out we did not order dessert we decided to walk out to their coffee shop for dessertbrbrthe dinner costed us rs108000 which isnt value for money but not too heavy on the pocket for an upscale restaurantbrbrwhat i would recommendbr1 the tomato basil soup broccoli soup both are just perfect starts to a meal amazingly delicious wonderfully served and perfectly madebr2 the pastas and pizzas i have tried a few different ones on the menu and if i had to pick a favourite it would be the aglio olio and the alfredo pink saucebrwe ordered the gnocchi once and that was a disaster i am not ready to experiment with againbr3 the thai curry the best i have had till date in bhopalbr4 the wine list is worth a try they provide a larger variety than most places in townbrbra little piece of advice always order what you know you can enjoy and eat i usually order weird stuff off menus and experiment but this has been one place where every risk and experiment has been a big fail for mebrbri will definitely be going back for the food and vibe and the simple feeling of being in a super eclectic

MoMo Cafe - Courtyard by Marriott,Mudra Keswani,https://www.zoma.to/pAwOqO,sunday is the most important day of the week well at least for me people who know me also know the fact that while i used to live in bangalore i used to go for breakfast hopping on every sunday sadly we dont have the concept of breakfast cafes in bhopal but thank the lord that there are brunches sundays are one of those days that we tend to skip the breakfast time and we look forward to lunch at early hours hence we have something called as brunch which does the job of both brbri quiet like the concept of sunday brunch as that particular day you get to spend time with you family and friends over good food and drinks one can just not complain of not enjoying their sunday brunch or there is nothing that will interest them you sure have so many options to explore and hog around the placebrbrrecently i was invited to experience the sunday brunch at momo cafe courtyard by marriott bhopal for those who know dont know much about me this place has a soft corner in my heart as i started my career from this place as an intern my first vlog was also for marriott so now you know why i love marriott brbrthe smart folks at courtyard marriott decided to organize the brunch live counters and buffet spread completely indoors this means that the dessert counter greets you at the entrance of the restaurant and you know right away what you want to keep space for brbrchaat counterbrbrapart from the eye catchy dessert counter next thing to catch your attention is the lovely chaat counter serving absolutely lipsmacking chaat such as dahi puri pani puri chole tikki papdi chat bhel puri etcbrbrsalads brbrthe salads and cold cuts are my favourite way to start on a buffet i absolutely loved the variety of salads that were on display i particularly loved the caprese salad radish salad greek salad and broccoli peanut fete saladbrbrdrinks brbra brunch is incomplete without good drinks to accompany your meal i was served with a customised mocktail named orange shooter which was tangy and sweet if youre not very keen to go in for drinks which i recommend you should give a go you can try out the soups along with a variety of breadsbrbrgrills the starters brbrcontinuing my culinary journey of a perfect sunday with a delectable and exquisite brunch i next moved to live grills and starters you have a plethora of choices including live grills chinese and indian starters choose your own vegnon veg and let the chef do the magic for youbrbrstarters included marriotts signature galoutte kebabs which are cooked using high temperatures in the tandoor the flavours which emerge are a delicious combination of smoky yet subtle while the textures are rich soft and succulent shezwan potatoes which were boiled potatoes made in shezwan sauce and garnished with sesame seeds very similar to honey chilly potatoes but not very sweet fried rice the quintessential chinese favourite veggies chopped into juliennes a whole lot of spring onions and some soy sauce tossed together with steamed rice and creamy potatoes well wasnt the real name but this tasted absolutely brilliant creamy and cheesy flavours blending well with the boiled potatoes and grilled in oven brbrmain coursebrbralong with the indian meal that im going to describe below i also called in for pasta arabiata from the live pasta counter unfortunately i was so hungry that for once i forgot to click a pictures of a few things thanks to anmol for sending me some of the pictures but let me assure you that the italian counter wont disappoint youbrbraloo hing hara dhaniya stir fried potatoes with aromatic masalas lemon juice ginger chillies and with a pungent taste of hing a perfect dish on the sidebrbrmix vegetable a tangy tomatoes gravy crunchy onions and a basketful of colourful veggies with indian masalas you get a tonguetickling delicacy that is hard to resist brbrpaneer lababdar paneer cubes in an aromatic spicy gravy with saut√©ed onions kasoori methi and a hearty dollop of cream and butter paneer lababdar is sure to be the highlight of your mealbrbrand then came the chef with a surprise brbra bowl of bread dipped in niharibrbrtheres a special nihari section and guess what theres an option for both veg and non vegbrbrfor a person like me who is trying hard to go towards complete vegetarianism its even more harder to resist the fragrance of the dishes that you used to love having in the past well if i cant consume nalli nihari i sure can consume veg nihari which is basically spicy and flavourful stew and loved it when it was served with breads dipped in it brbrdal panchamel and dal makhani dal panchamel or dal panchratna a wholesome combo of five dals is flavoured with a special masala water and whole spices as well not only the flavours of the spices but the flavours of the assorted dals are also discernable in this delightful dish talking about the dal makhani which is made with red kidney beans and black gram it was cooked with plenty of butter and selected spices which make it rich creamy and delicious let me tell you one more thing with my past 4 years of dining experience at marriott bhopal this place never disappoints when it comes to dal makhani and i can even assure you with the fact that you cannot find a better dal makhani in whole bhopal i always end up having 2 bowls of it because its absolutely heavenly brbraloo methi ki tahiri one dish wonder made with rice methi and potatoes in aromatic indian spices and it‚Äôs prepared from scratch ‚Äì no ready made or the store bought masalas here this main dish is full of flavor and texture but i found it very average for i wish there was biryani on the buffet that they specialise in brbrdesserts brbrtake a look at the dessert spread it is smartly set up just after the elevator and is the first thing you see you will instantly know what to keep room for or even what you want to start withbrbrno better way to end the feast with exquisite and alluring desserts which were handcrafted to perfection this was my favourite section from the whole brunch and i tell you there are so many options that you cant decide what to savour and what to put down brbrthe mini cup cakes were so cute and pretty that i fell in love with them red velvet chocolate chip minion cup cake and vanilla flavoured happy sunday cupcakes are the star of the dessert section and you just cannot afford to miss them more things you can look forward to carrot cake fruit pudding rum balls fresh fruit cake layered chocolate cake which had loads of layers of differentdifferent chocolates and they melt in your mouth thick raspberry yogurt and my all time favourite serredura you can splurge on indian desserts like milk cake pista pedas carrot halwa etc brbrthe winner of the whole brunch was the gudd ka rasgulla soft melt in mouth cottage cheese balls in silky smooth brown jaggery syrup well as they save the best for the last and chef made me taste this when i was done with trying out the desserts that i had on my plate this dessert hits you hard on your taste buds and mark my words youll fall for this particular dessert and will end up eating not one but two or may be more rasgullas a sure shot hit brbrby this time i was almost high on desserts and i had to skip a few more things which my heart wasnt ready to leave but i had tobrbrthe sunday beer brunch at momo cafe courtyard by marriott is priced at inr 1500 ai per person with unlimited beer mojito vodkatini cosmopolitan and bloody mary is kinda steal the

MoMo Cafe - Courtyard by Marriott,Neha Khandelwal,https://www.zoma.to/oMRNyl,when you walk into momo cafe the first impression you get is that it is a beautiful and classy fine dining restaurant the crowd is elite and the staff looks so well groomed that it just makes you slow down straighten your back and want to be as sophisticated as the surroundings but that is the end to what youll enjoy on your visit there the staff is slightly confused and hassled with extremely delayed service the food is just horrible i dont know who is cooking in there but they need a strong reminder of what good food tastes likebrthe thing i really appreciated was that the entire staff was very well behaved and even let the kids run upto the buffet and pile up their plates with dessert and we werent charged for it eitherbrbrwhat we ordered br1 french fries these tasted generic and like the deep frozen kind that just come out of the packet and into the fryer but no complaints therebr2 mushroom soup this looked like a bowl of gooey sludge it was thick and pasty and totally disgusting two spoonfuls and i was done havent ordered mushroom soup anywhere ever sincebr3 tomato soup was a good soup but not the best we have hadbr4 pesto pasta salad the leaves were a little bitter and the pesto did not have any salt in it tasted average and forgettablebr5 pasta arabiatta was simply weird the sauce tasted like a can of tomato puree with some salt and oregano not cooked or tempered in butter and 6 of us couldnt finish even one portionbr6 hakka noodles we loved it very well made and a delight to eatbr7 paneer tikka the paneer was delightful soft and well cooked and tasted perfectbr8 potato wedges never made it to the table and we never enquired after them eitherbrbrmain coursebr9 paneer butter masala was the worst paneer gravy i have ever eaten in my life the paneer pieces were good but the gravy tasted like tomato puree with a few mild spices and very uncookedbr10 handi chicken again it was pretty tasteless and had just a lot of chopped green chillies in the tasteless gravybr11 dal makhani thick and very bland with a load of butter nothing special br12 chicken dum biryani the dinner was starting to feel like a fiasco when the biryani came it was delightful and i was shocked they only served plain curd as an accompaniment and that was the only disappointing thing about the biryani it was lip smacking deliciousbr13 tandoori rotis and naan the breads were well made and served hot and the saving grace to those horrific curries brbrwhat made it worse was that they already have a very tight and limited menu and a few dishes we wanted to order were not available so it left us with very limited choicesbri wouldnt recommend the place if you truly enjoy eating good food if you are

the realization kicks in that there is nothing better in the whole wide world than a mughlai indian gosht the food from the place had my bite from has surely arrived and arrived bigbrthis is what happened with my first bite of gosht rizala the other daybrthe lamb was perfect the gravy was perfect and the marrow oozing out was perfect i shamelessly asked for a complementary bowl of curd and they gladly served brbrthis was day onebrbri was lucky enough to get the chance of having a breakfast buffet and dinner buffet the next daythe breakfast had to be a lavish affair and it was couldnt get my hands on a lot of things to be honest was terribly occupied with office work so i literally had 24 bites of eachbrbrbreakfast no 1brupma which was delicious btw poha bircher muesli i never ever miss a chance to find one on a bountiful breakfast table anywhere sauted veggies with chicken sausage and corns and a little bread pakoda which again was fabulousbrbrdinner bra lot of people would say that not having a company can be tough sometimes eating alone just doesnt feel good but i over the years because of my travel i have had my shares of lonely experiences and somehow have found the right balance to enjoy them so dinner was one man one table thing againbrstarted off with the salads loved the tangy broccoli so much that i could have accidentally shortened their supply for the service jokes apart the salads gave my meal a perfect start with a bite each of the paneer chutney tikka chicken reshmi tikka and the fish starter paired the broccoli with kimchi to make it a killer combo in no timebrbrdid not have a lot in the mains to be honest but i should remember what all was therebrbrhummus baba ganoush mint curd greek saladbrdaal palak achari lamb gobhi masala spicy sabz baharbronion rice biryani brcurd and condiments to diy raita do it yourselvesbrthere was a continental side of food too which was predominantly fish and i dont remember what was it exactly brbrthe food had to be fantabulous but i felt that there was a bit of niggle with the hummus it felt very salty and very grainy casually asked the server if it was just me or was it really under prepared i forgot soon after and went back to my meal when chef saurabh came and to my utter surprise he admitted that the hummus was somehow lacking in a lot of things and was way too salty they removed the hummus part from the salad tablebrbrnow the desserts brsour cream cherry chantilly was the best of the best of the best captain brhave never ever tasted such a light cream pudding like dessert it was layered with flavours troubled to find the right combination of words right now to describe brwith the rest of them i could see all my theoretical knowledge coz of masterchef and chopped and coming to life the sugary tuile and crumbly pastry and panna cotta and caramel custard and mud cake pudding and then the indian part with baked gulab jamun and rose kheer perfectionbrbrbreakfast 2brnow this was a surprise walked in to be told that it was complimentary well how good is thatbrand like a true indian hearing free food i became hungry like jughead and sunk in well to enjoy one thing at a timebrthis is an account once again brstarted with my usual plate of fruits and a newer type of sprouts malka daal ie whole red lentils then a mixed parantha aalu gobhi pyaaz done lightly in desi ghee bregg whited typical indian omelette was next very well done nonrunnybrmy usual bircher muesli was replaced with strawberrry curd and blackberry curd for good bra handful of mixed nuts and a bite of cold pastry finished it upbrbrwow this review has become more like an account book of what i ate in the nutshell whatever and where ever i grabbed i bite from momo cafe everything was simply outstanding which to be honest was really expected toobrbra really humble thank you to the chefs and the servers and the staff who have been tirelessly doing their job day after day which includes

Sanchi - Sayaji Hotel,AM,https://www.zoma.to/DKkbLR,i will tell you how there was an insect floating on the mocktail i ordered but before that let me tell you how the same dinner turned out to be the most satisfying one in this era of fine dining tradition sanchi is a place which never fails to disappoint you sayaji after all these years remains fiercely beloved amongst diners the bhopal franchise lives upto the tradition located on van vihar road the surroundings are calm green and lonelyat night i must admit i was a little unnerved by the place at night but once you enter the gates everything seems good brbrthe restaurant has a vivid setting with one intense golden shade of light dominanting the area the hall is divided into two sections one with the bar and one away from it decorated with masterpieces and wooden furniture it gives you a feel of a contemporary fine dining restaurant moreover the amazing glasses used to serve water and the crockery adds to it the music is just perfect and so is the ambiencebrbrbeing a decorated hotel the service is prompt staff is courteous and polite though on my third visit i experienced some lack of attentiveness from the staff this time there was an insect in my mocktail which they changed without any questions this shows how particular about the taste and quality of food there is a particular policy of the hotel which i appreciate they dont take tips in short the hotel staff has been quite welcoming towards the guests a few glitches here and there are acceptablebrbrthe food menu is a blend of comprehensive indian cuisine along with some variety of chinese and continental the beverages menu is an elaborate affair with an interesting range of spirits and mocktails though most of the hard drinks are subject to availability spice girl was the mocktail i ordered it was predominantly a khus flavored drink with a refreshing taste and signal green colour the first course of my meal consisted of scrumptious indian starter platter with fish tikka chicken tikka sheekh kebab and prawns the kebabs were succulent and delicious whereas crispy konjee lamb was burnt and shish kebab wasnt up to the mark coming to the main course the bread basket was an interested package of assorted indian breads murg e agan prawn curry and murg pashtun are my personal recommendations the meat was properly cooked and fresh gravy was rich and satisfying overall the food will always make me visit this place especially the indian dishes the price card is well in accordance with the quality of food and ambiencebrbrto conclude i had a pleasant dining experience with food of the most exquisite flavours for this reason and a comforting drive i highly recommend going to sanchi for a family dinnerbrbr,4.0,"['tell', 'insect', 'floating',

delightful and hearty bowl of spicy noodle broth which are no more on their menuheartbroken also the best aglioolio spaghetti which is again off their menubut every time we request for it we have been served this dishbrbrthe thing to note and kudos to the management for this is that they take care of and pay attention to every little single tiny minuscule detail the water glasses are always filled

courteous they make you feel welcomed warm and extremely comfortable hospitality is what honestly makes jehan numa stand out from all the other hotels in this citybrambience is royal and again very different from that of others their buffet stretch was huge from soups to various kinds of bread a cheese platter salads deviled eggs dahi badas veg and non veg kebabs veg and non veg tikkas chinese and thai section of gravies and noodles baked counter pasta counter two kinds of rice veg and non veg gravy vegetables types of naans and rotis and a dessert counterbrpresentation is really good it tempts you to eatbrwell i tried eating the maximum dishes so that i could give a proper reviewbrhot sour soup was actually brilliant why did i say so its because mostly when served hot and sour the soup is way too hot the black pepper used is way too much and gives ones throat a bad time rather here one could taste the hotness of the soup with the sweetness of the veggies and gave peace to ones throat moving on to the salad counter had watermelon and feta which was brilliant corn salad which was accompanied with green bell peppers and lemon juice tomato and red chilly powder and did taste good homegrown lettuce salad and this is one of the best juiciest fresh lettuce i have had roasted chicken salad which was scrumptious to the core the chicken pieces were roasted to perfection with little spices and brilliant moving to the main course their dal fry was finger licking good with perfect amount of tadka tomato rice was average nothing different or special about it paneer laziz had soft and tender pieces of paneer cooked in tomato cream and cashew gravy which was extremely rich in taste kele ki subzi was something unique which generally people fear cooking is because if not cooked well the combination of spices and bananas give an extremely bad taste it wasnt bad quite bland and highly plain in taste still couldnt make me love this vegetable and add on to my favorite list junglee maas was something i had for the first time and was quite spicy so people who love spicy foodit should be your pick babycorn cigars were dipped in batter and deep fried and gave sweet and sour taste all together and was one of the good starters mushroom stronganoff was something which took my heart creamy and rich in taste the mushrooms were covered in thick creamy red gravy chicken lehsuni tikka was good but not something i havent tasted before it did taste quite common chicken methi tikka was extremely tasty the best i have had till date the chicken pieces were marinated well in spices and methi leaves and they were juicy and tender enough to melt in your mouth simply loved itbrone should have a developed tastetaste buds for fishes and various kinds of cheese i tried the hunan fish and smoked cheese for the first time the fish even after being cooked had a very strong smell the smoked cheese had a pungent taste and gave a hint of bitterness as soon as you swallow it so go for these two only if you wish to build your taste buds or already have developed onesbrlets move on and satiate our sweet toothbrchocolate mousse soft perfect melting and brilliantbrbrownie
