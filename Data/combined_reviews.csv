32 Degree North East,Shubham K,https://www.zoma.to/LmOlRgn,Overall okay. I went for the first time. Paneer sushi in general was good but one can't say it's sushi. Siya chaap was nice. Daal makhani and paneer kadhai along with tandoori roti all good. Nachos with baked beans was a turn off. They baked nachos as well and brought each nacho separately. It was burnt as well. <br/>We asked them that this is not made like this. Staff is courteous. Another thing is service is too slow. We waited atleast 15 mins for starters n half hr for main course. When we paid bill after that finger bowl came. This area really needs improvement.<br/>Rest I would recommend as place is little different with nice natural view.,3.0

The ambiance is amazing, i love the fact that you can have your privacy while you come here which is all thanks to the way the seating arrangements have been made. I think this place is good even if you are going out with family so its not specifically an all young generation place.¬†<br/><br/>¬†They serve shessha and the food is also amazing. They have great variety in menu. Also the presentation of food is good. The staff is cordial and helping.¬†<br/><br/>I have just two reasons why i have not given it a 5 on 5 one being that Alcohol is not available. I sure wish that was done as sometimes when you just want to quiet place to chill and drink, i don't see many such options in Bhopal for the same. The second reason being when you come here with family or small kids it is difficult for them to climb up because of the stairs and its also a little scary with them, though they also have options to sit at other places but since the place is mostly crowded gets difficult sometimes.",4.0

32 Degree North East,Nickey Rathore,https://www.zoma.to/YKdyNpn,"If you want to ruin your day, waste your money, Spoil your taste bud and wait for long hours, you should totally visit this place.<br/>I went with a bunch of people to celebrate my husband's bday and it was a total disaster. We received our starters 40-45 mins after order and main course didn't arrive for more than 90 mins after we placed our order. When we decided to walk out asking them to cancel our order and bill for the food we actually had, their owner/manager came rushing to us and started convincing us saying that our food is ready and we should have it. We kept on telling him that we have other commitments yet he didn't budge and forced us to have the food saying it's on the house (which actually wasn't.) <br/>Coming onto the food:<br/>We ordered boti soya chaap and Afghani soya chaap, which were both a blot to what we usually get in Delhi. Next we ordered crispy corn which wasn't crispy at all, it was anything but crispy corn. Baked bean nachos were extremely soggy and distasteful. Chaanch was just thick curd with lots of corriander leaves and spices.<br/>Kurkuri bhindi was so pathetic that an ideal kurkuri bhindi might just want to commit suicide after seeing it. The list is long since we were very enthusiastic about trying this place and food. But in a nutshell everything about this place except for its outdoor setup is a huge let down and total waste of your time and money. Staff isn't courteous and polite at all. Management and service sucks. Staying home and making yourself a bowl of boiled Maggie is far a better option than visiting this good for nothing place.",1.0

This place is located near Kerwa Dam. This place is built on forest theme. They have Machan everywhere to sit. There are trees everywhere giving you that peaceful and calm vibes. A place away from city‚Äôs life and is quite serene.<br/><br/>Talking about their food, they serve variety of Indian, continental, Chinese and Asian cuisine. Very few places serve such variety of food in town. This is one of them. Sharing my experience of dishes I have tried there-<br/><br/>01. LAYERED BAEBELINO: This was a mocktail. It had dark pink red color. This was basically combination of Blueberry crush and cranberry juice. I found it a little more sweeter than it should have been. Rest the flavours of blueberry and cranberry coming off good. A refreshing drink indeed.<br/><br/>02. PANEER SUSHI: This was something new to me as I have never heard of Paneer sushi before. Though it wasn‚Äôt something like authentic sushi but they have moderated sushi as per local taste. There were small roles which were made of cornflour and later stuffed with vegetables and grated cottage cheese. It was then topped with cheese. I liked this sushi. It had a mild taste.<br/><br/>03. BANGKOK BREAD CROQUETTES: A croquette is basically a small breadcrumbed Fried roll containing meat, fish etc but again they have moderated it and made the Indian version of it. Breadcrumbed Fried rolls were stuffed with mashed veggies and cottage cheese and served in thick red gravy. This had a good taste. <br/><br/>04. CHAAP PLATTER: One of my favourite from the evening. They served 4 different variety of Chaap in a small rail engine shaped thing. I really like the presentation. The platter had Desi Chaap, Achari Chaap, Afghani Chaap and Boti Chaap. All the chaaps were perfectly cooked. Also, the chaaps are made from soyabean. It was served with green mint chutney and onions. Highly recommend.<br/><br/>05. WHITE SAUCE PASTA: Penne pasta which was cooked in white sauce along with veggies like broccoli, bell peppers etc was creamy and rich. It had mild flavour and had a decent taste.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a nice place to hangout with your friends, family or anyone. A place which is peaceful and beautiful. Also, their food is delicious.<br/><br/>Ratings-<br/><br/>FOOD: 4/5<br/><br/>AMBIANCE: 4.5/5<br/><br/>SERVICE: 4/5<br/><br/>A place you can definitely give a try.

Boscos,Devashish Sharma,https://www.zoma.to/lMpRPNK,"A Mixed Bag of Magic and Disappointment<br/><br/>As a regular patron since this restaurant first opened its doors, I‚Äôve always had a soft spot for its unique ambiance and once-distinctive menu that set it apart from other places in Bhopal. However, my experience on August 17, 2024,  left much to be desired.<br/><br/>Let‚Äôs start with the positives: the atmosphere last night was nothing short of magical. The evening was elevated by two incredible musicians‚Äîa lady with a voice that could melt even the most stressed-out diner, and a male vocalist who also played the guitar with effortless charm. Their performances were the highlight of the night, creating an enchanting vibe that, frankly, saved the evening from being a complete letdown.<br/><br/>Now, onto the not-so-pleasant parts. The service was disappointingly slow, a stark contrast to the efficient and attentive experience I‚Äôve come to expect from this place. The wait times were unreasonable, and the food, which once stood out as innovative and flavorful, was lackluster at best. The flavors seemed to have lost their punch, and the dishes now resemble what you‚Äôd find at any other mediocre spot in town.<br/><br/>To make matters worse, the cocktails were downright bad. They lacked the balance and creativity that used to make them a standout on the menu. It‚Äôs as if the passion and attention to detail that once characterized this place have gradually faded away.<br/><br/>I couldn‚Äôt help but notice that the familiar faces who used to manage the restaurant with such care and professionalism were nowhere to be seen. Only a couple of staff members from the early days seem to still be around, and the difference in management quality is painfully apparent.<br/><br/>In summary, while the restaurant still has the potential to shine‚Äîespecially with talented performers like the ones last night‚Äîthe overall experience is slipping. I‚Äôm giving a higher rating mainly because of the magical atmosphere created by the singers, but I sincerely hope the management takes this as a wake-up call to bring back the charm that made this place special in the first place. Otherwise, it risks being overshadowed by the new spots that are rapidly gaining popularity in Bhopal.",3.0

Cafe Amado,Yash Gadwal,https://www.zoma.to/vBYGzPg,"Cafe AMADO has a nice ambience, and a location that's unbeatable (debatable, but let's not go there, as this is a review, not a place to fight). But is the ambience just enough to guarantee a good time? Read ahead to find out.<br/><br/>I visited this place with a friend of mine. We had lunch in our minds, so, AMADO was the place of choice. +1 for the location, it's located in the heart of Arera Colony. The ambiance is quite comforting and Boho. They did go all out in decorating the place to give it a free-spirited look. :)<br/><br/>Being Italian food enthusiasts, we got ourselves a plate full of Penne in Alfredo sauce, plus the Three Pepper Chipotle Cottage Cheese Pizza, with an additional request to 'spice up' the pizza sauce a bit, which the folks didn't comply with eventually. To accompany the food, we got 2 drinks, pictured. One Hazelnut Frappe, and an Iced Tea of some sort, I don't really remember the name of it.<br/><br/>Coming to the taste, of the food, the pizza sauce was underseasoned and the base turned soggy by the time it reached our table. The toppings were not seasoned, and we were surprisingly greeted by raw veggies to make things better or worse, you decide. The pasta sauce (Alfredo) was a bummer. We instructed to make sure that there's no dryness to the pasta and the pasta to be cooked to perfection, but the pasta was on the dryer side. The Frapp√© was bittersweet, the way it should be (?), and the iced tea was ""okay"" as per my compadre.<br/><br/>Overall, I'd give this place a generous 3/5 üåüs. Thank you for reading, if you've made it this far.<br/><br/>P. S., coming to the prices, we paid 600 per person (1.2k ish) for 4 items.",3.0
Cafe Amado,Ishita Madhu Yadav,https://www.zoma.to/gAYbooR,"Had a terrible service. They assigned us waiting area table & rather then giving us new vacant tables they made new arriving people sit there, instead of us . After me asking a few times they gave us a table but in sometime made us share table with others which they said will be for two minutes but as it turned out the other party completed their meal at our table and then left.Me and my friend were very uncomfortable with the other people on the table. So we waited for the other party to leave before ordering. After our meal we asked staff to get leftover pasta packed( as more than half was left) ..they asked us to vacate table and to wait while they brought the package. After waiting sometime on asking we find out that they didn‚Äôt pack anything and were not even apologetic towards it. On speaking to the manager , he apologised but the food was wasted with no compensation on their part. Needless to say it was our last trip to the cafe.",1.0

Black pepper fish was ok ,the rice served with it could have fit a small green chutney bowl(itna bhi kyu diya sir). The Strawberry cheesecake was alright but the Tiramisu lacked any coffee flavour,was heavy on pallet and was lack luster. The croissant was so dry that one could use it as loofah.

Cafe Amado,Divya Rai,https://www.zoma.to/qeAzDyZ,"Visited this place for breakfast, particularly drawn by their highly touted fruit bowls. Our experience, however, left much to be desired. The smoothie bowl arrived in a small soup bowl and came with a hefty price tag of Rs. 350.<br/><br/>I don't mind paying for quality, but I do take issue when quantity falls far short of expectations, all in the name of 'fanciness' and 'health.' In other metro cities, you can enjoy a similarly priced smoothie bowl, but with a much heartier serving.<br/><br/>Even the omelette didn't quite meet the mark. For a better breakfast option at a more reasonable price, I'd recommend checking out BBC at 10 Number Market. Unfortunately, this is yet another cafe in Bhopal that's falling short in terms of portion sizes. Not recommended for breakfast due to the high prices and small quantities",1.0

The service was reasonably quick and almost all the food came quite fast.<br/><br/>For food we ordered Loaded Wedges, Verdure pizza, Veg Lasagna, and Spinach and Feta cheese Cannelloni - all of it delicious, served hot and at a good portion size.<br/><br/>For beverages we ordered 3 spritzers - Lychee and Kaffir Lime, Guava chilli, and Pomegranate and  Raspberry - again, all of them delicious, served chilled.<br/><br/>All this food and beverages for 2k is more than worth it. 12/10 would recommend if good food and ambience are what you're looking for.

I‚Äôm writing my review here as I highly doubt my feedback will reach the hotel management as they don‚Äôt have any feedback form but a register page which can be teared off from the register easily. IF YOU DONT HAVE SEATING ARRANGEMENTS THEN PLEASE DONT TAKE DINING ORDERS. Took us almost 30 min to find a proper seating and the ones who arrived after us were made seated before us. I had hopes from this place as I heard about the hotel and the cafe a lot, Was never upto the standards. We ordered 3 coffees and except for cappuccino the Americano and the latte with vanilla flavour was the worst coffee I‚Äôve ever had. What to say about blueberry cheesecake, the beautiful it looks the stale it tastes. It was not fresh at all. The only good thing was the puff, but having so many options for puff as aloo mutter puff and veg puff came to know both are same, then why take orders for two puffs aloo mutter and veg puff?? We left our coffees and our food half eaten due to this. The last as in this corona time, if someone requests for an extra masks the hotel won‚Äôt have it.

But when I went back to her after 30 mins to avail my offer, she said that she has to speak to her owner, take her permission, before allowing me to place order. This was ridiculous. When I asked her, why she didn't spoke to her owner earlier and take clarifications, to which, she had no answer. I further requested to let me speak to her owner or else give me her contact Details, she again denied.

Despite of informing them about our menu and the quantity to be served along with the timings of the guests etc they weren't prepared at all. They started with serving starters and they brought just two plates for 30people, are you kidding me??? Yeahhh, that's what they did.. Then when slowly and gradually we were thinking that they might catch the pace but they didn't and we completely lost the patience, we called the manager but he completely vanished and didn't show up!!

On one hand the ambience is cozy, the sheer number of plants lends it a cottagecore vibe. But on the other hand, the food leaves something to desire. <br/><br/>We ordered a starter, a pasta and 2 drinks: <br/>1. Smashed Garlic Broccoli - 2/5 - we expected broccoli florets steamed, smashed and cooked in garlic butter but found a bed of sweet (WHY????) creamy base (consistency and texture of hummus) topped with whole garlic pods and smashed broccoli. Our tastebuds were very confused and not in a good way.<br/>2. Creamy Mushroom and Spinach Spaghetti - 3/5 - the portion was pretty small but there was a decent amount of flavour (could do with reducing some salt though) but it brought back memories of opening your tiffin box in school and finding cold Maggi cake. <br/>3. Citrus Orange cold brew - 2/5 - I usually love this combination, but you expect a cold brew to be... Cold???? This was more like they mixed room temperature boxed orange juice and cold brew and then added 12 ice cubes in it which ruined the enjoyment of my cold brew.<br/>4. Citrus Lemon iced tea - 2/5 - it was more water than iced tea, and I kept looking for the citrus flavour but didn't find much. <br/><br/>Overall, go for the ambience, but our experience of food wasn't positive. Getting 30% through Zomato Gold did lessen the disappointment in their food, but would not repeat / recommend.",2.0

Green House Bistro,Aashi Saxena,https://www.zoma.to/dNopnOk,"This is not for the food or the service but your so called 'policies' which are abysmal to say the least, at times. The restaurant opens up at 11 AM but god forbid if somebody comes early, they won't even let them inside the premises. I repeatedly assured the gatekeeper that I will not be roaming in the restaurant but will only be waiting in the premises, he blatantly refused. The location at which the restaurant is, isn't exactly crowded which is why I was apprehensive of waiting all by myself outside in a secluded location.<br/>After all this, when I asked the gatekeeper to at least let me talk to the person concerned, he blatantly refused to do that too. Amazing. üëèüèªüëèüèª Nobody is dying to come to a restaurant before it opens up, but in situations like these, there was not even a bit of concern shown. I wonder if someone is dying outside, would y'all still ask them 'Oh please wait outside, we can't let you in even on the premises.'? Oh wait, don't answer that, it is a rheotorical question. üôÉThere are far bigger and better places, in Metro cities too, but none of the people there behave the way you guys did.",1.0
Green House Bistro,Jatin Tripathi,https://www.zoma.to/vevnpw,"<br/><br/>I'm just going to say this outright -- BEST Caf√© in Bhopal by a mile!<br/><br/>Ambience - Ethereal is the word to describe this place, the indoor section is lit very well with nothing too bright making you feel cosy in an instant, it is brought alive by a wide array of plants that seem to engulf the place, a much welcome break from your typical brick & mortar interiors, which literally & figuratively freshen up the place. The outside is serene and surrounded the by the farm fresh produce that the caf√© uses in all its products. Organic, Fresh, Local are the keywords.<br/><br/>Service - The servers are Prompt in attending to you and catering to your needs they are well mannered, polite and have a good understanding of all the items on the menu. Very lively, they do everything to make your experience that much more enjoyable. Adds just that little extra to your experience, but the difference between something ordinary and extraordinary is that little 'extra'.<br/><br/>Food - Delectable, I've tried their Black Bun Mutton Burger, Vegetarian Club Sandwich, Margherita Pizza, Mexican toast and the Orange ginger juice and I am delighted to tell you for the life of me I cannot find fault with any of them.<br/>A special mention must be given to the Black Bun Burger and the Margherita Pizza, the burger is BANG ON what a good burger is supposed to be it's messy it's big, the mutton patty is insanely juicy the bacon strips do wonders and they are topped with very cheesy aioli. The Pizza just oozes freshness, the dough is that perfect balance between crunchy and chewy which is the first marker of a really good pizza, if I HAD to be pedantic and nitpick I'd say this - The Margherita pizza was created for Queen Margherita to represent the three colours in the Italian national flag so I think they should make their sauce little more red, right now it's like a deep orange.<br/><br/>Final Verdict:- Jehan Numa have hit the ball out of the park with this one, dare I say they haven't put a step wrong. The price at which you are getting all this Quality is something to note, a meal for two may cost north of ‚Çπ800, which believe me is incredible value for money.<br/><br/>Cheers. :)<br/><br/>PS, apologies for the slightly blurry couple of photos, was quite inebriated on my first visitüòÖ<br/>",5.0
Green House Bistro,Shrey Jain,https://www.zoma.to/rwgxMKO,Taste is not bad but charging 110+ taxes per water bottle for a 20rs bisleri bottle is not worth at all. Paying 520+ taxes for a pizza is alright for a place like this but water and taxes is not good for such a nice place.,1.0

It‚Äôs got an indoor and outdoor section which are both equally green! The food‚Äôs great too! I really like their BBQ Chicken (Jalape√±o and Onion) pizza. Even the Quatro Fromaggi is a great option to consider but if you‚Äôre not a blue cheese person (or trying it for the first time/ still acquiring the taste for it) I‚Äôd recommend to not let it sit and stale!

Told the waiter but not even a basic apology, much less anything else, so not expected this at jehanuma out of all. They took forever to deliver the order. I can understand the Sunday rush etc but the slow service was an appetite killer. For that matter we had to ask for basic things like cutlery, water, clean the table etc. very very disappointing. So the two stars are gone here. <br/><br/>The pakodas were so crispy & nice but as I mentioned the strange service they gave the dessert & tea before & pakodas at last. <br/><br/>Inspite of such a perfect place & polite staff, service wasn‚Äôt up to the mark at all.",3.0

Green House Bistro,Faiz Saeed,https://www.zoma.to/vxBmYOa,"Having experienced horrible service at jehanuma retreat about 5 years ago, it took a lot of convincing for me to go and give them another chance...and to be honest it was a pleasant surprise...the pizza and the burger were really well made and tasted excellent...so after a month i thought of having a quick lunch at the bistro again...and what a mistake it turned out to be....right from the clueless waiters to the bistro manager who had no clue of which table was occupied / reserved ...to the waitress who had absolutely no command of english or hindi language and had no clue about the menu! MENU : if i can call it a menu that is...almost nothing was available ..no veg options...only one kind of pizza...no variations available in burgersüòñ ...the mezze platter which we ordered was a joke...horrible to taste with just one pita bread with 4 small tequila shots glasses filled with a small tea spoon of hummus and 3 other starters....horrible to taste and look at...then came the burgers...the waitress was specially told to add certain ingredients which she nodded to while taking the order....but to my surprise when the order came...everything explained to her in simple english and hindi was missing...the burger tasted bland and had got nothing which was there when i had visited previously...guys enough of brand name jehanuma...i will better off at having my fav buffet next door at sayaji...for burgers i will happily zomato burger king üôè‚ò∫Ô∏è...pull up your socks green house bistro...poor show again<br/>",1.0

I would never consider to repeat my experience when it comes to food. The condiments served were inaccurate as per order. And when I pay good that means you should think of using actual coconut cream but not the syrup or essence in mocktails or cocktails. Any good dine-in use fresh cream, then why is Taj charging too much but serving lesser to avearage. People go there for a vibe, I get it, but food and drinks should be top-notch.

I opted for  Risotto , immediately I got answer that we will prepare Risotto of for you but you have to pay more than the listed price on menu posted here on Zomato . which sounds crazy to me but since I was hungry I thought okay no point arguing .  but I was finding it difficult to read the menu on my phone I requested at least you provide me hard copy of the menu I will choose the item and if you wish you a charge little higher . after sometime the better return and told that no the menu cards are in the locker and they cannot take that out as there was hardly any item on the menu I had to leave the restaurant hungry . I raise the complain and at least Zomato people were concerned and kindly love and they return by booking charges of Rs 50 üëåüôèüèΩ‚ù§Ô∏èü§£",1.0

Barring ones that know their onions, butter chicken in Delhi NCR has been relegated to a tart and overly acidic tasting chicken tandoori doused in under-done tomato gravy. Here thou shalt mirthfully discover what truly Butter Chicken meant to be! Its a magical recipe that took the winds out of the wings of them British subjugators (them = rulers). Celebrated as the epitome of the genius spawned off a human mind under duress, this recipe is easily the ""most ordered"" dish that I have seen in my humble outings with friends and family.

Now, there was some Kashmiri food festival going on when I visited kebabsville, I was always fascinated by the concept of barbecue on table, However, perticularly talking about this outlet, It's more of a gimmick, There wasn't really many options in veg for grilling, most of the starters were served directly on the plate, I am not saying it was bad, but was like any other decent restaurant.<br/>When I visited, the place was pretty crowded hence the service was a bit slow! Main course and sweet dish were great! Worth trying! Starters were considerable, I am comparing it to the Barbecue nation in Delhi and in terms of service/taste and value for money, barbecue nation easily outperforms this one as that one is cheaper and you get more variety and prompt service despite the crowd!<br/>",4.0

The buffet has about 2 soups, 8 main dishes along with nan,rice and noodles. The desserts are also quite tasty but can definitely be improved!  A meal for two will come to 2000 rs excluding drinks.

Now about the taste of the dishes, the dishes which I love are as follows, in starters I would suggest to go for roasted pineapple, roasted prawns, chicken tikka and for roasted chicken leg. In meals, two dishes were served that were hariyali chicken korma and dhaba mutton. Well I was more interested in Dum Mutton Briyani, it was one of its kinda taste( i will recommend it the most).

Coming straight to food, i found the buffet horrendous. Snacks were absolutely ridiculous. Tandoori items, every single one of them felt like i was chewing rubber. All of them tasted alike. The main course menu was also highly disappointing. They had only one edible dish - butter chicken. Desserts were tasteless. I couldn't fathom why the crowd was pouncing on buffet. Ambience, i would say the open restaurant is a good concept but only at those places where you don't get wasps and flies landing on your food! Converting the swimming pool area to restaurant made the whole area look more like a shaadi hall instead of giving it the posh look they'd been hoping for. Rain also acted as a dampener. 2 stars because the buffet was cheap. At rs 600 for veg buffet, it's alright. I have been told to go on a better day again. But will I? I think not.",2.0

Kebabsville - Sayaji Hotel,Himank,https://www.zoma.to/MQqEkP,"TLDR : Amazing and worth the price. Improve desserts please :)<br/>Full review-<br/>Unlimited barbeque..... For a foodie, the two words 'unlimited' and 'barbeque' are always a delight to hear and when combined its always a treat!<br/>Unlike Delhi,Mumbai etc, Bhopal has very less unlimited barbeque live grill concept restaurants. Among few is Kebabsville of Sayaji. My review includes Non veg<br/>First the price. Its ‚Çπ1050 for non veg. A bit on higher side when compared to bbq nation and all. However the quality makes up for it.<br/>The ambience is good, there is a pool which makes for a beautiful scenery and especially if you are thinking of a date ;)<br/>The starters include Chicken tangri, chicken tikka, fish tikka, mutton kebabs and even chilli chicken you can get if you ask chef. Chicken was soft and moist and tasty. For veg starts you have mushroom, paneer tikka and since I went during food festival time, fried banana chips and Quesadillas which was okay. In short the starters were very good.<br/>Main course is good and chicken curries are nice. The bread is soft and tasty as well.<br/>Now comes the dessert... And I believe this is the only area where Kebabsville is average. The desserts are limited in option and among all, only few are tasting good. Some of desserts k tasted like fruit custard, blueberry cake, cheesecake etc. Were not good. Chocolate mouse was tasty. In context of desserts, Kebabsville need alot of improvement otherwise it would have easily gotten a 5.<br/>But still, it's an amazing experience and the tasty food justifies the 1000 rupees.<br/>The staff is amazing and very courteous. They fullfill your requests as much possible and like BBQ Nation they don't accept tips!<br/>Oh and there is Live singing as well which is lovely. My friend had birthday and the siger and staff sang song for him along with cake. Things like these make Live BBQ even better!<br/>Really recommend you all to go and enjoy the food !<br/><br/>",4.0

Kebabsville - Sayaji Hotel,Pratik Mathur,https://www.zoma.to/BkpNlxd,"This is a post regarding poor quality buffet at KEBABSVILLE, SAYAJI, BHOPAL. <br/>I with some friends from Lucknow went for dinner yesterday. Even after spending a whopping 9.5k, we were so disappointed that we have blacklisted this buffet in our list. <br/>The veg section feels like a waste of 840 bucks. They serve same old paneer and mushroom on the grill, like they have been doing every single night. There has never been any variation. While my non veg lover friends enjoy different tikkas and starters every time. Either the chef's are too incapable of making something else, or the management doesn't want to. In either case, the customer wastes their money. <br/><br/>We ordered cocktails which were again a terrible experience. The cocktails were watered down so much that you could barely taste any alcohol. Screwdriver was just plain orange juice, LIT had everything else but alcohol, and Old Fashioned was just sweet water. <br/><br/>The main course was again disappointing, for thr vegetarians of course. Lack of chef's thinking power comes into action here. All they can make is a paneer dish and a mix veg. While again my non veg lover friends enjoy countless varieties of dishes. <br/><br/>I hope this bitter review reaches the management and the chef's so that we can atleast be satisfied of the costly buffets we order in the coming times. For me, I'll stay away from this place for a year or two until I hear good reviews again..<br/><br/>PS: they've paid the local food bloggers and foodie groups so that they don't publish bad experiences.

Kebabsville - Sayaji Hotel,Julie Bania,https://www.zoma.to/YydKZN,"Bhopal has very few options when it comes to buffet. And of those few options the one worth visiting is this place. The very first thing you observe while entering is the ambiance, such a lovely setting beside a pool. The receptionist will guide you to your table based on the number of people,  and while entering one can observe the beautiful lighting and live music playing in one corner. The service is very good, you will have your own waiter serving you specially and making sure that you are satisfied with the food. There are numerous starters starting from grilled prawns, kebabs, chicken legs, fish etc( I opted the non veg buffet). The main course ranges from variety of soups, salads, Indian and Chinese cuisines. You finally end your meal with desserts having all kinds of pastries,mousses,custards, ice creams, brownies etc etc. So you can see, this place is a best combo of good food+ good ambiance.<br/><br/>Also almost every month there are food carnivals and festivals going on where you are lucky enough to enjoy special cuisines.

Starters are nice but options are very limited, especially for vegetarians. Main course is average at best. Spices are imbalanced in many of the dishes. Breads were the only take away. Desserts are decent. Rasgulla was awful though. They served cold gulab jamun which in my opinion is best served warm. Staff was friendly but numbers were limited. Had to wait for very long to get attention of staff. There was live music which was good in quality but they took long breaks between performances. Overall it wasn't worth it at all.",3.0

Kebabsville - Sayaji Hotel,Sam,https://www.zoma.to/nMXLqv,"Amazing hospitality yummy food nice polite and helpful staff. This time sayaji bhopal didnt disappointed us. Though indore one did it lastly. Last time we opted for a la cart√®.. This time We went for a buffet dinner yesterday it was a closed ones birthday dinner out and we opted for non-veg buffet dinner. All the chicken starters were so yummy even the fish starter this time was good enough plus the mutton galawati kebabs were a real time authentic because its hard to find this softness of it in bhopal city though we didnt had the prawns. The starters were themself hunger satisfying with yummy taste. Approx total 6 variety of starters.<br/><br/>Coming to the main course the chicken dum biryani was lipsmacking even jehanuma hadn't served ever this much tasty biryani till now, just a personal review. The chicken and mutton gravy dish were also very yummy although i didnt liked the fish gravy. The breads were so soft to make a morsel with gravy we had butter naan and garlic naan.<br/><br/>The desserts were also good and with so many options served we just got confused what and what not to eat cuz we were too filled up n not a big fan of sweets. These too were approx 6 or 7 which were more then enough.<br/><br/>Thumbs up cuz they pre arranged the table decor cake when came to know about the respective person's birthday. We tried to give them tip but they politely said no to us again n again for it as tips are not allowed over there, this thing too is different from other hotels here. Lovely it was. Thanks a lot. I'm surely n definitely will gonna visit again n again now for the buffets rather then having it elsewhere.",5.0

It gives me great pleasure to review this fantastic place.¬†<br/><br/>I was meeting my family after a long time and decided to take them out to a fine dine place. I settled on Kebabsville mostly because of the pool side seating which looked stunning in the pictures. It didn't disappoint. The ambiance was very well done from the arrangement of tables around pools to the ghazals that were being live performed.¬†<br/><br/>The buffet offered a lot of variety ranging from DIY barbecue starters to myriad of sweet dishes. The veg kebabs were very delightful. Grilled fish was another delicious offering. It's hard to list all the dishes that left me wanting for more but some great ones were Keema Kaleji and grilled prawn. The main course had a lot of vegetarian and non-vegetarian options but nothing stood out. It seemed average especially in comparison to the starters. Moving to sweet dishes, the fresh made Jalebis with rabdi was my favorite and filled my soul with syrupy sweetness. :) Overall, the food was a good but I hope it would be even better the next time around.<br/><br/>The service was flawless. I have no comment on it except to commend the entire staff for their warmth and professionalism in creating a memorable experience for us.<br/><br/>This is an experience I would definitely recommend to everyone.",4.0

Kebabsville - Sayaji Hotel,Manas Bhargava,https://www.zoma.to/DEeRGm,"Firstly, kudos to Sayaji for bringing the DIY BBQ Buffet concept to Bhopal. I had eaten such buffets at Barbeque Nations and Absolute Barbeques in Bangalore and Goa but when I went here with my family, all of them were so happy to see a new concept of sorts of having dinner.¬†<br/><br/>Moving on, the ambiance is great. If you are looking for a lovely poolside¬†quiet dinner, this can easily your pick.¬†<br/><br/>There is a llloooooooooottt of variety on the table. Starters, Desserts, Main course. By the end of it, surely you will lose count of how many things and what all you have eaten. Especially for non-vegetarians, the place is an absolute treat.¬†<br/><br/>Coming to the bad things, well I can point out just two. One is the cost which is slightly high (not if you compare it to similar buffet places but definitely if you compare it to other places in Bhopal). Secondly, this is not a place where you can go again and again. The menu becomes monotonous and I feel vegetarians are left with really limited options (they don't¬†have anything apart from Paneer, aloo and Mushroom in any buffet anyways).¬†<br/><br/>So, I would say that this place can be visited for a one-off experience, especially if you have not been to such a DIY buffet place ever.",4.5

Kebabsville - Sayaji Hotel,Chaahat,https://www.zoma.to/xgDxXl,"One of the very few places in Bhopal where prior table reservation is highly recommended. <br/>When we went to Kebabsville, they had Punjabi as a theme for everything. Right from ambience to food. <br/>The entire restaurant right from its entrance had punjabi flavour to it including decorations and punjabi dress code for servers. We were escorted to our table by the pool. You're first served starters which include few live grill dishes such as paneer, pineapple and few others such as pani puri, corn, kebab and couple of more. It's highly recommended to have as little starters as possible to enjoy their buffet to the fullest. Then there were punjabi dance performances along with live music as fillers. <br/>In buffet, the savoury dishes were slightly disappointing. I particularly had sarso da saag and makhi di roti and I literally missed the original flavours therein. Then I hogged onto the desserts. The highlights and showstoppers were some hara halwa and jalebi with phirni. <br/>The total cost of the buffet including taxes with one redbull and one mocktail was around 2,300rs which was fairly decent considering the overall great quality of experience and memorable night Kebabsville offered.",4.5

Kebabsville - Sayaji Hotel,Rakshit Shastri,https://www.zoma.to/AaRDGM,One of my top three choices when I want to have a drink outside. The lovely concept of grilling your own meat while sipping on a beverage is very enticing. Not to mention the fact that they keep serving additions that the professionals have grilled to mask the misadventures that some of us might have had. Always a good spread. Not much variation but does the job well.,4.0

Kebabsville - Sayaji Hotel,Shilpa Sonkar,https://www.zoma.to/mzoYzy,"A bit out of town location and non residents like me, not so easy to navigate from the airport; but all that was faded out of my mind as soon as I entered this place.<br/><br/>It's basically a poolside restaurant with barbeque style food with an add-on buffet. Considering we were there in the thick of winter, the air was icy to say the least. But eating those delish kebabs on fire was a treat- neatly marinated, perfect blend of spice and succulent taste... Yummy. Not to forget the amazing biryani from the buffet, total nawabi feeling. We also enjoyed the desserts in our very brief visit.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, we were running quite a tight schedule to put it mildly.... So we'll be remembered as people hogging this superb food in mad rush and then sprinting towards our waiting cab.<br/><br/>But no worries, this place will be on our mind as and when we be in Bhopal.",4.0

Kebabsville - Sayaji Hotel,Sach,https://www.zoma.to/bRBmvY,"Kebabsville as we all know is the pilot for world famous Barbeque Nation Restaurant chain across India. They have been the pioneers in the Live Grill on the tablen concept. Totally love the concept but off late have visited the Bhopal outlet during the festivals they do. <br/><br/>Today was an Arabic Food festival. Though the food quality was as good as always, service was impeccable as always i feel that though they do food festivals food somehow remains the same. Other than fancy Arabic names that 99% janta wont be able to pronounce or relate to, the food was as Indian as it could be. Same was the case with the Kashmiri food festival last month. <br/><br/>Desserts were good though with Umali and Baklava I feel over all they missed the plot by including regular Chaat, normal Indian breads, same old tangri and prawns in the starters. <br/><br/>On top of it the music playex during the Belle dancing was deafening to a point where you could not even talk to your next seat neighbour if the dance was on. So even though the dancer was pretty good we were wanting for it to stop rightaway. And this is when we were at the farthest table possible. <br/><br/>Guys you do a good job throughtout the year but please you need to make sure that during the food festivals we need to eat something that you do not do on regular days.",2.5

Kebabsville - Sayaji Hotel,Nandini Mishra,https://www.zoma.to/AMyBvqZ,"Not worth the hype, rating and price. The food was not good. The marination on the starter was too spicy. Ambience is okay, not that great. Since it‚Äôs open air restaurant, a lot of food items had moisture and didn‚Äôt retain the crunch. Desserts were horrible. Definitely not going another time. I‚Äôm not sure about non-veg food, but veg was worthless and tasteless.",1.0
Kebabsville - Sayaji Hotel,Leena Manik,https://www.zoma.to/gxbePZ,"As this restaurant is part of sayaji, therefore it is very evident that ambience has to be elegant and sophisticated.<br/>This place has barbeque  theme...you will get everything for around Rs 700. This will include scrumptious starters followed by full fledged food and desert. This is buffet so one can have wide varieties to treat their taste buds in veg as well as non veg.<br/>They will also have live Sufi music performances.<br/>I must recommended this place to all the gourmets out there to go and try out the only authenticated barbeque in Bhopal.",4.0

For e.g. what we ordered was Hunter lamb steak, but what we got was a flavorless patty of minced lamb (which can never qualify as a steak).¬†<br/><br/>However they made a good pepperoni Pizza for which I might forgive them their mess of a steak!

La Kuchina - Jehan Numa Palace,Sach,https://www.zoma.to/MbaAqk,"Father's day brunch at La Kuchina and it was an ok experience. <br/><br/>To start with Veggie Harvest and Mango Mint Juice didn't tantalize the taste buds at all. Pretty ordinary and bland for the most part including the presentation. <br/><br/>Spanish Tortilla with hash browns and Baked beans came to the table cold and Chocolate Chip Pancakes could not even make it to the table for the entire course of the meal. <br/><br/>We never tried the Soups in the offering but Salads on the buffet were real nice. Fresh to an extent that you can feel the crunch even if you take it from the buffet and were dressed to perfection.<br/><br/>Olive Caper and Tomato dressed Chicken, Crispy Lamb Noodles with  bolognaise sauce were outstanding, perfectly seasoned very plated and served at the right temperature.<br/><br/>Seafood Risotto, Four Cheese Penne and Pizza were as good as always. <br/><br/>What dissapointed the most was the breakfast breads on the buffet as they looked and tasted were ordinary. Sugar Free Panacotta, Baked Yogurt were real good. Correct texture, right flavours and was just a perfect end that one would have wanted. Banana filled pancakes were served soggy and cold. <br/><br/>For the most part service is what was not upto the mark and it felt like it was due to the kitchen that was having difficulty coping up with an alacarte style brunch. If it was a tradition live station on a buffet set up - the service and overall experience would have been much better. <br/><br/>I am pretty sure ut will be much better next time.",3.5

We were in a group of 3 with one male member and 2 females. Why is it a preconceived notion that if one scotch is ordered it will served to the male member of the group with out even asking who ordered what. Also the check was literally handed to the guy and wasn‚Äôt kept on the table as if women even today are not ready to bear the cost of a dinner.

The waiters are attentive and are glad to suggest you delicacies. Music in background is soft and pleasing. <br/><br/>I had a Penne Alfredo, Veg Shashlik and Veg lasagne. The dishes tasted as good as they looked! Every bite of 'em was savored :')  No doubt, they were the best in Bhopal. <br/><br/>You can order drinks too here, but you won't have happy hours here, like at Tattenham (Jehan Numa's bar). Although wines are available at a discounted rate.<br/><br/>Do keep an eye on the 'today's special menu'.<br/>Do not forget to have a look at the kitchen, where you can see our so loved delicacies being prepared to tingle our taste buds.<br/><br/>The only downside here is that the place is expensive.

We tried the veg piri piri pizza, chicken sashlik and arrabiata pasta with chicken. The pizza tasted nice, though it had a slight resemblance in terms of taste to home baked pizzas. The pasta was initially raw tomato-y, but once we informed the management about it, they replaced the dish and it came back better cooked and tastier !

We haven't seen fancier set up than this or such finesse in cooking either all throughout the capital city! While we tried a wholesome bit of a lot of items, what still lingers in our minds are a few things:<br/><br/>Miso, Potato and Porcini Soup with Goat Cheese Cream and herb oil - The delicately accentuated flavour, the creamy texture and the whiff of shrooms just makes this soup probably the finest we've ever had anywhere!<br/><br/>Sundried Tomato Pesto Gnocchi with cherry tomatoes and basil foam - this one's no secret, they restaurant is known for its Gnocchi and hence we had to try it!

Must have!<br/><br/>Of the other items were Clear Soup, Spinach and Ricotta Crepes, Mushroom and Cheese Stuffed Cannelloni, Spinach and Feta Stuffed Chicken and more which could've been a little more flavourful but were delicious nonetheless!¬†<br/><br/>P.S - The staff is very accommodating!

I don't generally have too big of a problem with undercooked food as long as when pointed out the staff changes it or asks me for another selection. Since that didn't happen, I'm writing this review. As a former hotelier, I wanted or maybe expected you guys to be a bit more professional and proactive given how the Gastro or the coffee shop staff is.

The draught beer tasted quite similar to kingfisher premium, could be wrong about it. The lamb steak was bang average which was completely ruined by the extra salty sauce. I know at such restaurants we are paying for the ambience but to be honest the place can do so much better, I expected the lake side view and what not but it was a small cafe type place and you could see the hotel guests checking in and out.

The moment I entered I was welcomed by this delicious smell of garlic and herbs and very warm aromatic ambience. The white walls, dim lights, simple furniture and large windows give you that feeling of being somewhere else.<br/><br/>Service was just opposite of caf√© chino. In fact the best service I have received anywhere in town.<br/><br/>Coming to the most essential part: Food. It goes like this:<br/><br/>1. Strawberry Ginger: Great drink to quench your thirst. If you are a strawberry fan do order. Stir it a lil bit or else taste settles down for the last sip. Taste compliments anything you order.<br/><br/>2. Smoked Chicken, Parmesan and Semi dried Tomatoes Salad: A good option for salad. This place serves really good smoked chicken.<br/><br/>3. Corn and Spinach Crispy : I don't know why this thing was ordered on the table. One may not like this if he doesn't like spinach. Crispy enough but oily which I expected it to be.<br/><br/>4. Black Pepper and Walnut Crusted Chicken Tenders: I was disappointed. Could be because I expected a lot out of it. My friends did like it. I loved that perfect crunch but it was too bland for my taste buds.<br/><br/>5. Smoked Chicken Pasta: As said earlier they are good at smoked chicken.<br/><br/>6. Risotto Primavera: The best I had at Big Chill in Delhi and next was here.<br/><br/>7. Pizza: You can ask for two different choice of toppings in one pizza.<br/><br/>(A)  Smoked Chicken, Jalapeno and Onion.<br/>(B) All chicken<br/>(C) BBQ Chicken, Green Pepper, Spring Onion. <br/><br/>Love increased with the alphabets. Smoked chicken compared to other two failed this time. There is tie between All Chicken and BBQ. Had them at two different visits.<br/><br/>8. Chicken Ravioli: Although removed from the menu you can ask them to serve it. It's their discretion. Someone suggested me to try this out. It was good but I do not prefer red pasta so I didn't eat with much delight.<br/><br/>9. Hunters Lamb Steak first steak of my life and I loved it. It was served with some sauce, probably with cheese, topped with baked eggs. Delectable. With every bite I was on cloud nine.<br/><br/>10. Grilled Tiger Prawn: Here comes the best part. I love sea food and this dish was best. If you love that flavour of prawns you gonna love it and the crab meat risotto with creamy texture is such a soothing delight to those taste buds.<br/><br/>With respect to price, I found it a bit higher but the hole in the pocket won't pinch your heart for long because of the experience.

La Kuchina - Jehan Numa Palace,Mayur Joshi,https://www.zoma.to/gnBzzQ,"Situated within the Jehan Numa... Came out as a nice surprise for the cuisine served . Good fresh Italian/ Mediterranean food with a glass of draught beer to accompany... We tried the broccoli soup which was brilliant in terms of taste... Served with freshly baked portions of bread, taste was subtle and creamy... Loved it... The black pepper crusted chicken was good but not exceptional. We ordered the smoked salmon pizza and the all chicken one. The Norwegian smoked salmon was quite nice with the smoky salmon taste not necessarily overpowering the pizza.. Perfectly balanced... Didnt enjoy  the all chicken one... Not to my taste... Have to mention the roasted peanuts served with the beer.... The best I have had so far!!! Ever... Was locally sourced and yummy to the core ...",4.0
La Kuchina - Jehan Numa Palace,Nipun Gupta,https://www.zoma.to/oKkynl,La Kachina is a restaurant located inside Jehan Numa hotel. The restaurant offers very comfortable and cosy sitting ambience and serves Continental cuisine. Their thin crust pizzas are out of this world. Plus they have a very different type of appetizers which one must try particularly their Platter which has Lebanese food. Have visited this place with friends and colleagues. Hard drinks are also served here. Once I had visited with my friend and did not find anything great to eat from the menu. The chef came to our table and suggested something customized to us and it was absolutely amazing. Little expensive but food and ambience is worth the money.,4.5
La Kuchina - Jehan Numa Palace,Simran,https://www.zoma.to/nLDReBe,"The place probably has the best thin crust pizza in Bhopal. Will definitely go there again just for it. <br/><br/>However, the second dish we ordered - white sauce pasta - was really bad. It tasted too much of flour and was overly milky, not even creamy. It was tough to even finish half of it. <br/><br/>As far as drinks are concerned, there version of Singaporean Sling is really good and worth checking out.",4.0
La Kuchina - Jehan Numa Palace,Christopher Charles,https://www.zoma.to/BEwMDX,"This is probably the best Italian restaurant in the city of Bhopal. The chef doesn't look Italian but he seems to ""think Italian!""<br/>He even seems to have noddles in his head, and a spegetti brain! Try the Zucchini Parmesan Soup if you don't believe me? Or, nibble on a Mozzarella Gnocchi Sorrentina while sipping a Doppio Caffee! But wait a minute, where did the Grilled Rack of New Zealand Lamb come from (perhaps from the fabled Italian South Seas Islands?)! Or, the Braised Lamb Steak? Maybe Roman lambs?<br/>And, from the Chicago  Mafia we have for you Walnut Pie and Cheese Cake! Mama Mia---",4.5

La Kuchina - Jehan Numa Palace,Shubhorup Biswas,https://www.zoma.to/qDxPlp,"While planning a rendezvous at Bhopal with a batch-mate from IIT, a few WhatsApp exchanges had frozen the dinner slot on Friday evening. On picking me up, he had offered a few options for the venue but Jehan Numa Palace won hands down for its quality of food as we had experienced in our previous dinner five years ago. In a not so agreeable climate of early June, we had navigated through an erratic traffic of the city and on reaching the hotel premises handed the car keys to the valet parking attendant. Toying with the choices of Indian versus continental food, the latter had weighed heavier and we proceeded to ‚ÄòLa Kuchina‚Äô, a fine dining outlet for Italian and other Mediterranean cuisines.   <br/><br/>My friend was ushered in with warm greetings by the Manager and wait staffs as an acknowledgement of his frequent visits. We settled down comfortably on a corner table within a largish dining space, still quite empty at 8.30 PM. The eatery was almost full within half an hour though. The interiors of Jehan Numa Palace were designed impeccably while highlighting the heritage characters of the property. The elegant but not so resplendent d√©cor, muted lighting and heavy drapery all contributed in crafting an ambiance rich with legacy. <br/><br/>The ma√Ætre d‚Äô while noting our preferences, politely suggested the items for catering to our tastes better. For our choice of drinks, I went for Smirnoff with lime cordial & soda, my friend opted for the Scotch, Black & White with soda. We asked for ‚Äòprawns cocktail‚Äô as the starter and one portion of the soup, ‚Äòchicken & ginger broth‚Äô to be shared by two of us. The salad came with a good number of ‚Äòtail on‚Äô medium sized prawns. And the soup tasted simply excellent with an exuding aroma. For the main courses, we chose ‚ÄòChicken Saganaki‚Äô with Tzatziki sauce and ‚ÄòSouthern fried chicken with saut√©ed vegetables‚Äô. Saganaki, a rich, tomatoey and typically Greek preparation, was served in a large quantity with chunks of chicken.  Tzatziki sauce, another Mediterranean speciality, prepared with strained yoghurt with cucumber, garlic, salt and olive oil, has been extensively used for meat dishes and also as dip for the meats. The dish while looking very healthy tasted a bit bland for our palates. Southern fried chicken came in the form of not so thick pan fried and thinly crusted boneless chicken fillets served with the plentiful of fried potato and saut√©ed broccoli, beans etc. We came back quite satiated promising to return in the near future to enhance our gastronomical delights. <br/>My only regret has been that I had missed taking photos of the dishes served as were so engrossed in our journey down the memory lane.¬†<br/><br/>Jehan Numa Palace has etched out a position of pride in the culinary map of Bhopal with its exotic offerings to the denizens of the city.",4.0

This place is serene and has different vibes which is sometimes spoiled by loud music. In all I just love this place.They also keep organising Pizza fest's to serve variety, those have always been good. As far as charges go, I won't say those are high because the kind of food is served its worth it all. In all I think improvement can be done in the variety of drinks probably wines of different countries  so on & so forth. It's interior makes it look this place even more peaceful.<br/>",5.0
La Kuchina - Jehan Numa Palace,Pallavi Singhal,https://www.zoma.to/ekRZAv,"After a long wait, they accommodated us in a rather full restaurant on a busy 31st December lunch. The place was rather full with them having to turn away guests. My eyes popped out on seeing dal and naan being served, and Khausuey and Rogan Josh on the menu in what is claimed to be an authentic Italian restaurant, but it seemed to work well to cater to different taste buds. The bread basket seems a tad bit stale, as the breads were not smelling fresh and right out of the oven. The cheese on the breads also tasted like the Britannia/Mother Dairy kind of cheese rather than a good cheddar/mozzarella. Any good Italian caf√©/restaurant always boasts of olive oil and a squiggle of balsamic vinegar at the table to go with the breads, but that was missing. The main course was authentic in the form of spinach stuffed ravioli and the grilled fish. The servings were also rather big. I wish they had touched up the rough edges and they would be such a star of a restaurant!",2.0
La Kuchina - Jehan Numa Palace,Neha Khandelwal,https://www.zoma.to/xgdXGo,"What lies behind that quaint green door?<br/>Every time I go to Jehan numa palace I am really amused by the fact that the door to La Kuchina remains closed, like it's hiding a wonderful secret inside! And it really is a wonderful little space with an open kitchen and amazing hospitality.<br/><br/>Luxurious and high end from the food to the decor, this place oozes sophistication and I hate to admit it, but I tend to spend an extra half hour getting dressed if I know I am headed there for the night.<br/>So a favourite, visited from the land of sheiks,sands, and oil and we ended up at our yearly ritual girls night spot for some downtime.<br/><br/>La kuchina has a lovely drinks menu with a good wine list, which we skipped on this particular night.<br/>The food menu is Italian heaven and one can compare the variety and taste to any high end Italian restaurant in any of the big cities.<br/><br/>We walked into an almost empty room, that was buzzing with energy from the kitchen and found our favourite corner spot to settle down at. What I love about such places is that you don't have to worry about loud music or too many people and can kick back and have a REAL conversation.<br/><br/>What we ordered:<br/>1. Tomato and basil soup : <br/>Came in the prettiest bowls along with a platter of breads and tasted perfect! Tangy and creamy and warm was exactly what we needed in this weather. And the undertones of basil in every spoonful was simply perfect.<br/>2. Whole wheat penne in pink alfredo sauce with chicken(a first time order):<br/>The penne was perfectly cooked! Or should I say, perfectly ""al dente""! The pink alfredo sauce? Well I could have bowls full of just the sauce for dinner and be completely satisfied. The best pink sauce I have ever had! The chicken was cut into bite sized pieces and cooked on point! It wasn't as spicy as I would have liked, but then a little chilli flakes fixed it for me and my friend who isn't a spicy food fan had nothing to complain about.<br/>The only thing I could nit-pick about is that the pasta used wasn't all whole wheat only. We definitely found a few not wheat penne pieces in our pasta but since we were enjoying our meal we chose not to complain about it.<br/><br/>The meal was perfect, the company even better and it was just a lovely night out. We did not order dessert. We decided to walk out to their coffee shop for dessert.<br/><br/>The dinner costed us Rs.1080.00 which isn't value for money but not too heavy on the pocket for an upscale restaurant.<br/><br/>What I would recommend:<br/>1. The tomato basil soup/ broccoli soup : Both are just perfect starts to a meal, amazingly delicious, wonderfully served and perfectly made.<br/>2. The pastas and pizzas : I have tried a few different ones on the menu, and if I had to pick a favourite it would be the Aglio Olio, and the alfredo pink sauce.<br/>We ordered the gnocchi once and that was a disaster I am not ready to experiment with again.<br/>3. The Thai curry : The best I have had till date in Bhopal.<br/>4. The wine list is worth a try, they provide a larger variety than most places in town.<br/><br/>A little piece of advice, always order what you know you can enjoy and eat, I usually order weird stuff off menus and experiment but this has been one place where every risk and experiment has been a big fail for me.<br/><br/>I will definitely be going back for the food and vibe and the simple feeling of being in a super eclectic ambience because it just makes me feel better!<br/><br/>Overall experience -<br/>Food 9/10<br/>Ambience 10/10<br/>Service 9/10<br/>Cleanliness 10/10<br/>Price 8/10",4.5

So we ordered for Black Pepper and Walnut crusted Chicken tenders which they served with some garlic breads. This turns out to be delicious, Chicken breasts were tender as name said with perfect crispy fine coat of walnut's. A special sauce was served which was very new to taste buds. Spicy Primavera with Spaghetti was the next choice which had nice blend of herbs , Olive oil and tomatoes. To accomplish any Italian cuisine Pizzas are must so we tried Four Fourth pizza.

Some may know but many may not, one of the scenes and a song from Katrina and Ranbir starrer Rajneeti have been shot in this very restaurant only.<br/>At the outset I would like to mention that the staff (barring the manager) was over excited and concentrated towards foreign guests and showing little or no interest in the Indians. I hate such evident discrimination and I as well as Indians on the other table also felt the same. Though, the manager was courteous to ask us about our experience and confirm if we are treated well. Also, from a restaurant of this stature, I would have expected the staff to serve the food but that wasn't the case either. Service definitely needs a push here and that's why I am not rating this restaurant too high on a relative scale.<br/>Coming down to food, I had regular vegetarian pizza. Absolutely no complaints with the pizza. Perfectly cooked thin crust pizza with lot of vegetables. Exactly what I was carving for from a long time in Bhopal. Then I had fresh lime soda, which was not at all a fine dining experience. Very ordinary. <br/>A meal for one would cost around 700-800rs inclusive of taxes which for such good food at an elegant restaurant is pretty decent.",3.5

But at home they are not as authentic as you want them to be. The vibe is just beautiful. The taste is amazing and almost authentic. I love the place.

Not great on taste..<br/>Starters - Crispy corns, veg seekh, tandoori fruits, veg rolls have been nice. So was fruit punch.<br/>Main course not much tried but yes kinda decent.<br/>Desserts - spread on assorted pastries should be improved. However their Indian desserts - shahi tukda n rasmalai was v good. Malpua okayish.. red velvet n mousse also fine. By the time I went to desserts besan Laddoo was replaced with some weird dessert !<br/>What steals the show is seating outside near lawn n the view there.

Definitely liked it.<br/><br/>Ambience:<br/><br/>My recommendation is that if the weather permits, one must eat in the beautiful verandah overlooking the lake.<br/><br/>Overall, a good experience, excellent staff ensuring that you are well taken care of.",4.0

It wasn't available and secondly I ordered a wrap but that was also not available and even the hookah was unavailable so I just ordered a regular sandwich and Diet Coke and when I asked for bill, 18% TAX was charged. No GST number was mentioned in the bill. This is really so shameful and so unprofessional. Noor Us Sabah should stop fooling people around.",1.0
Marbal Arch - Noor Us Sabah Palace,Ananya Pandey,https://www.zoma.to/nvNgQey,"I treated my extended party to dinner at Marble Arch. We were seated in the garden with a beautiful view of the lake.<br/><br/>What I liked:<br/>1. I had requested for a wheelchair for one of my grandparents in advance and the staff obliged.<br/>2. I also had two guests with a gluten &amp; dairy allergy so the manager was extra careful about their food - the chef himself came out to tell us what gluten/dairy-free food options were available.<br/>3. We ordered veg kebab platter, kadhai paneer, navratan subz, bread baskets and kulfi. The food was exquisite *chef's kiss*.<br/>4. The service staff, although a little slow, was very polite.<br/><br/>What can improve:<br/>1. Our fresh lime sodas and desserts took a loooooooong time to arrive (which was a little embarrassing for me in front of my family). We had ordered some onion kulchas at the very beginning which arrived so late that everyone had almost finished eating.<br/>2. The service staff needed a little more training. I asked them twice to bring me physical food menus so that some of my non tech-savvy family members would find it easy to order. They just nodded yes and continued to set/clear the plates (completely ignoring my request *shrug*). <br/>3. The lighting was so dim that we almost couldn't see what we were eating.<br/>4. After dinner, I spoke to the manager and complimented their food and service, but I also mentioned the last three points - the manager seemed to have excuses for everything (for example, we put fresh lemons in fresh lime soda, we had to defrost the kulfi, these things take time, etc.)<br/>5. This restaurant is listed under the Zomato Pro category, but the manager told me they don't accept payments through Zomato Pro.<br/><br/><br/>TL;DR: Great food, polite service staff, service can be quicker.",4.0

Marbal Arch - Noor Us Sabah Palace,Pankaj Pruthi,https://www.zoma.to/LqeZqM,Tried this place while visiting Bhopal for a Business trip. It is an old Haveli converted to a resort. <br/>The restaurant does feel old but has the charm of its own.

To start with appetizers, both Chinese and Continental soups were up to the mark. We had kebab starters. The ajwain fish is a must try here.<br/>The biriyani was ok. I would say it's subtle but could have been more flavourful. In desserts, I tried the shahi tudka which was amazing.<br/>Overall a lovely dining experience! Would surely visit again.",4.0

The place is neat and the breakfast spread is just like any 4/5 star hotels. The outdoor seating was cool when it was overcast n we enjoyed the lovely views from our table. <br/>The lunch was good and the tastes were different. We ordered chicken tikka masala, fish curry and some mutton roghan josh. The service was good n the feerni for deserts was good too.. <br/>Forgot to mention abt the galauti kababs n lachha parathas we had in breakfast. It was really succulent m good taste. Also tried the mutton paya which was good n different from the Delhi wala recipe. <br/>Not to forget the awesome bhopali chai we had continuously there..

Followed by equally sad layout of main course. Non veg not really feeling fresh, dishes either over or undercooked, sad state of affairs in vegetarian section, decent breads though but appalling desert spread.<br/>Only thing worth while was outdoor seating which must be charming during evening.<br/>Slow service and nothing worthwhile to make a visit again.

The restaurant overlooks the famous bada talaab and has a gorgeous view as the palace is situated on the hill top.<br/>The staff is courteous and very hospitable. For our lunch, we ordered the Bhopali murgh rizala - a curry dish with authentic local flavours alongwith tandoori rotis which go very well with it. We also ordered the Dum Biryani which was one of the most aromatic biryani I've had in a while. The chicken was very well cooked and was quite tender. The biryani is served with a refreshing raita with a hint of mint in it.<br/>The overall dining experience was quite satisfying and I would strongly recommend that anybody in and around Bhopal must visit this place for the sheer experience of having authentic Bhopali food in a beautiful heritage palace.<br/>Also the restaurant is very well priced and worth every penny spent.",4.5

MoMo Cafe - Courtyard by Marriott,Mudra Keswani,https://www.zoma.to/pAwOqO,"Sunday is the most important day of the week. Well, at least for me. People who know me, also know the fact that while I used to live in Bangalore, I used to go for Breakfast Hopping on every Sunday. Sadly, we don't have the concept of Breakfast cafes in Bhopal. But, thank the lord that there are Brunches. Sundays are one of those days that we tend to skip the breakfast time and we look forward to lunch at early hours, hence we have something called as Brunch which does the job of both.¬†<br/><br/>I quiet like the concept of Sunday Brunch, as that particular day, you get to spend time with you family and friends over good food and drinks. One can just not complain of not enjoying their Sunday brunch or there is nothing that will interest them. You sure have so many options to explore and hog around the place.<br/><br/>Recently, I was invited to experience the Sunday Brunch at Momo Cafe, Courtyard by Marriott, Bhopal. For those who know don't know much about me, this place has a soft corner in my heart as I started my career from this place as an intern. My first vlog was also for Marriott. So now you know why I love Marriott!! :)<br/><br/>The smart folks at Courtyard Marriott decided to organize the brunch, live counters and buffet spread, completely indoors. This means that the dessert counter greets you at the entrance of the restaurant, and you know right away what you want to keep space for. ;)<br/><br/>Chaat Counter<br/><br/>Apart from the ""eye catchy"" dessert counter, next thing to catch your attention is the lovely Chaat Counter serving absolutely lip-smacking chaat such as Dahi Puri, Pani Puri, Chole Tikki, Papdi Chat , Bhel Puri etc.<br/><br/>Salads¬†<br/><br/>The salads and cold cuts are my favourite way to start on a buffet. I absolutely loved the variety of Salads that were on display. I particularly loved the Caprese Salad, Radish Salad, Greek Salad and Broccoli Peanut Fete Salad.<br/><br/>Drinks¬†<br/><br/>A brunch is incomplete without good drinks to accompany your meal. I was served with a customised mocktail named Orange Shooter which was tangy and sweet. If you're not very keen to go in for drinks (which I recommend you should give a go) you can try out the soups along with a variety of breads.<br/><br/>Grills & The Starters¬†<br/><br/>Continuing my culinary journey of a perfect Sunday with a delectable and exquisite brunch, I next moved to Live Grills and Starters. You have a plethora of choices, including live grills, Chinese and Indian Starters. Choose your own veg/non veg and let the chef do the magic for you.<br/><br/>Starters included Marriott's signature Galoutte Kebabs ( which are cooked using high temperatures in the tandoor. The flavours which emerge are a delicious combination of smoky yet subtle while the textures are rich, soft and succulent. ), Shezwan Potatoes (which were boiled potatoes made in shezwan sauce and garnished with sesame seeds, very similar to honey chilly potatoes but not very sweet), Fried Rice (The quintessential Chinese favourite. Veggies chopped into juliennes, a whole lot of spring onions and some soy sauce tossed together with steamed rice) and Creamy Potatoes (well wasn't the real name, but this tasted absolutely brilliant. Creamy and Cheesy flavours blending well with the boiled potatoes and grilled in oven.)¬†<br/><br/>Main Course<br/><br/>Along with the Indian meal that I'm going to describe below, I also called in for Pasta Arabiata from the live pasta counter. Unfortunately, I was so hungry that for once I forgot to click a pictures of a few things. (Thanks to Anmol for sending me some of the pictures) But, let me assure you that the Italian counter won't disappoint you.<br/><br/>Aloo Hing Hara Dhaniya: Stir fried potatoes with aromatic masalas, lemon juice, ginger, chillies and with a pungent taste of hing. A perfect dish on the side.<br/><br/>Mix Vegetable: A tangy tomatoes gravy, crunchy onions and a basketful of colourful veggies with Indian masalas. You get a tongue-tickling delicacy that is hard to resist.¬†<br/><br/>Paneer Lababdar: Paneer cubes in an aromatic, spicy gravy with saut√©ed onions, kasoori methi and a hearty dollop of cream and butter. Paneer Lababdar is sure to be the highlight of your meal.<br/><br/>And then came the Chef with a Surprise.¬†<br/><br/>A bowl of bread dipped in Nihari!!<br/><br/>There's a special Nihari Section and guess what? There's an option for both Veg and Non Veg!!<br/><br/>For a person like me, who is trying hard to go towards complete vegetarianism, it's even more harder to resist the fragrance of the dishes that you used to love having in the past. Well, If I can't consume Nalli Nihari, I sure can consume Veg Nihari which is basically spicy and flavourful stew and loved it when it was served with breads dipped in it.¬†<br/><br/>Dal Panchamel and Dal Makhani: Dal Panchamel or Dal Panchratna, a wholesome combo of five dals, is flavoured with a special masala water and whole spices as well! Not only the flavours of the spices, but the flavours of the assorted dals are also discernable in this delightful dish. Talking about the Dal Makhani, which is made with Red kidney beans and black gram, it was cooked with plenty of butter and selected spices which make it rich, creamy and delicious. Let me tell you one more thing with my past 4 years of dining experience at Marriott Bhopal, this place never disappoints when it comes to Dal Makhani and I can even assure you with the fact that you cannot find a better dal makhani in whole Bhopal. I always end up having 2 bowls of it because it's absolutely heavenly.¬†<br/><br/>Aloo Methi ki Tahiri: One dish wonder made with rice, methi and potatoes in aromatic Indian spices. And it‚Äôs prepared from scratch ‚Äì no ready made or the store bought masalas here. This main dish is full of flavor and texture. But, I found it very average. For I wish there was Biryani on the buffet that they specialise in.¬†<br/><br/>Desserts¬†<br/><br/>Take a look at the dessert spread. It is smartly set up just after the elevator and is the first thing you see. You will instantly know what to keep room for or even what you want to start with!<br/><br/>No better way to end the feast, with exquisite and alluring desserts, which were handcrafted to perfection. This was my favourite section from the whole brunch and I tell you, there are so many options that you can't decide what to savour and what to put down.¬†<br/><br/>The Mini Cup Cakes were so cute and pretty that I fell in love with them. Red velvet, Chocolate chip Minion Cup Cake and Vanilla flavoured Happy Sunday cupcakes are the star of the dessert section and you just cannot afford to miss them. More things you can look forward to; Carrot Cake , Fruit pudding, rum balls, fresh fruit cake, layered chocolate cake which had loads of layers of different-different chocolates and they melt in your mouth, Thick raspberry yogurt and my all time favourite serredura. You can splurge on Indian Desserts like Milk Cake, Pista Pedas, Carrot Halwa etc.¬†<br/><br/>The Winner of the whole brunch was the Gudd ka Rasgulla. Soft, melt in mouth cottage cheese balls in silky smooth brown jaggery syrup. Well, as they save the best for the last and Chef made me taste this when I was done with trying out the desserts that I had on my plate. This dessert hits you hard on your taste buds and mark my words you'll fall for this particular dessert and will end up eating not one but two or may be more rasgullas. A sure shot hit!!¬†<br/><br/>By this time I was almost high on desserts and I had to skip a few more things which my heart wasn't ready to leave but I had to!<br/><br/>The Sunday beer brunch at Momo Cafe, Courtyard by Marriott is priced at INR 1500/- A.I. per person with unlimited Beer, Mojito, Vodkatini, Cosmopolitan, and Bloody Mary is kinda 'Steal the Deal'. Good food, live music, a dedicated kids play area are the perfect ingredients in the recipe that makes a perfect Sunday Brunch with the family! Go Try out Now!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Head to Courtyard Marriott Bhopal for Sunday Brunch and share your experience with me. I would love to hear about it. :)<br/><br/>Till then, Happy Hogging!!<br/><br/>Chatori Meter: 4/5<br/><br/>P.S.

MoMo Cafe - Courtyard by Marriott,Nayan Dubey,https://www.zoma.to/nGyagwy,Even though the Ambience was lovely with Live Music and good service but the most important thing is Food!!<br/>And that was a major letdown!!<br/>Don't get me wrong they had a large & Very Assorted Variety of Food but when it comes to taste it was at best Sub-par!!<br/>There were not many options in Veg Main Course and the Rice was Literally Hard n Crunchy!<br/>And the biggest let down were the Desserts !! Very Beautiful to look so much so that I got every Western Dessert they had but they they were all a major let down!! Very elaborate looking but in terms of flavour and taste i felt almost Nauseated.<br/>So I would say<br/>Ambience - 5/5<br/>Service - 5/5<br/>Hygeine - 5/5<br/>But Food - 2/5( And that's me being Generous),3.0

Mains took again 40 minutes and then order biryani which took 25 mins. To add more, desserts which are ready took 15 mins to come to table. I was like how can something which is ready like biryani and desserts can take this much time.<br/>To make it more worse, got insect in my tandoori chicken starter, though it was replaced later with freshly prepared starter.<br/>I was not at all willing to pay almost 1.5K for that starter but never mind. Now after dinner we sat for 20 mins to get wet wipes, that pissed off my guests who went to washroom then to wash hands.<br/>I would like to mention that the staff was polite, gentle and courteous, but guess all went wrong on the day with them.<br/>Bottom line is, not worth paying 10k for this experience and the night was ruined, and being Marriott Bonvoy member, never experienced this in past.

The crowd is elite, and the staff looks so well groomed that it just makes you slow down, straighten your back and want to be as sophisticated as the surroundings. But that is the end to what you'll enjoy on your visit there. The staff is slightly confused, and hassled with extremely delayed service. The food is just horrible. I don't know who is cooking in there but they need a strong reminder of what good food tastes like.<br/>The thing I really appreciated was that the entire staff was very well behaved and even let the kids run upto the buffet and pile up their plates with dessert and we weren't charged for it either.<br/><br/>What we ordered :<br/>1. French fries : These tasted generic and like the deep frozen kind that just come out of the packet and into the fryer. But no complaints there.<br/>2. Mushroom soup : This looked like a bowl of gooey sludge. It was thick and pasty and totally disgusting. Two spoonfuls and I was done. Haven't ordered mushroom soup anywhere ever since.<br/>3. Tomato soup : Was a good soup but not the best we have had.<br/>4. Pesto pasta salad : The leaves were a little bitter and the pesto did not have any salt in it. Tasted average and forgettable.<br/>5. Pasta arabiatta : Was simply weird. The sauce tasted like a can of tomato puree with some salt and oregano. Not cooked or tempered in butter and 6 of us couldn't finish even one portion,<br/>6. Hakka noodles : We loved it! Very well made and a delight to eat.<br/>7. Paneer tikka : The paneer was delightful. Soft and well cooked and tasted perfect.<br/>8. Potato wedges : Never made it to the table. And we never enquired after them either.<br/><br/>Main course:<br/>9. Paneer butter masala : Was the worst paneer gravy I have ever eaten in my life. The paneer pieces were good but the gravy tasted like tomato puree with a few mild spices and very uncooked.<br/>10. Handi chicken : Again it was pretty tasteless and had just a lot of chopped green chillies in the tasteless gravy.<br/>11. Dal makhani : Thick and very bland with a load of butter. Nothing special. <br/>12. Chicken dum biryani : The dinner was starting to feel like a fiasco when the biryani came. It was delightful and I was shocked. They only served plain curd as an accompaniment and that was the only disappointing thing about the biryani. It was lip smacking delicious!<br/>13. Tandoori rotis and naan : The breads were well made and served hot and the saving grace to those horrific curries. <br/><br/>What made it worse was that they already have a very tight and limited menu, and a few dishes we wanted to order were not available so it left us with very limited choices.<br/>I wouldn't recommend the place if you truly enjoy eating good food. If you are in the mood for amazing ambience and some quiet conversations then this is your place to go to.<br/><br/>Overall experience-<br/>Food 3/10<br/>Ambience 10/10<br/>Price 7/10<br/>Service 7/10<br/>Cleanliness 10/10",2.5

MoMo Cafe - Courtyard by Marriott,Simran Khorana (TruExplore),https://www.zoma.to/DNgaRB,"Have tried their buffet dinner 3-4 times, however never once have been satisfied with their appetizers and maincourse dishes. The appetizers have alwsys been cold as if made a couple of hours ago. You will keep on trying different maincourse dishes to finely find only a single dish which may satisfy your palatte. ( that too if you are lucky). The variety of desserts is impressive but the diversity is not much. Still better than the appetizers n maincourse. Overall not worth the price of the buffet for cold appetizers and one average maincourse. Also visited twice on their food festival during august. Both the times the food was dissatisfactory. Service by the live counter is also pathetic.",1.0
MoMo Cafe - Courtyard by Marriott,Aishwarya Maini,https://www.zoma.to/nQbZkl,"While I was traveling through MP we decide to visit Marriott for good hearty dinner but got anything but that.¬†<br/><br/>We attended the buffet at this restaurant that claimed to serve delicacies from across North Indian, Chinese and continental cuisines.¬†<br/><br/>The establishment is quite modern as are all of Marriott hotels, well lit, spacious with ample personal space at the tables.¬†<br/><br/>The buffet was quite an elaborate spread with items ranging from soups to salads to chaats and of course main course and a wide range of desserts. Despite the extensive options available, there were very few items at the spread that one would go back for seconds to.¬†<br/><br/>The few of such items for me were the manchow soup, chaats from their chaat section, chicken pulao, hot chocolate pudding, lemon bavarian for dessert.¬†<br/><br/>Given the taste, the prices seemed exorbitant. The service was quite tardy with a huge lag that led to finished plates laying on the table with no space for fresh ones. We just ended up shifting seats to make space as the restaurant was quite empty thankfully.¬†<br/><br/>What started out as a promising dinner experience turned out to be a rather dispiriting affair.¬†<br/>",2.5

MoMo Cafe - Courtyard by Marriott,Sahiba,https://www.zoma.to/OEdlrq,"I don't have to explain you about quality of food and ambience here. It's well known. The place has formal or fine dine ambience which definitely makes me uncomfortable. But the food is such soothing panacea.<br/><br/> So let me start with things you can specifically try out at buffet.<br/><br/>BREAKFAST<br/><br/>Parathas- Best Parathas I have eaten were in Punjab and next is this place. They have number of stuffing options to gratify those cravings. My favourite is paneer stuffed.<br/><br/>Pancakes- No words to explain that <br/>euphoria and satisfaction when you have the first bite of your pancakes drizzled with honey. My faourite is Banana and ChocoChip Pancakes.<br/><br/>Love omelettes? Do order cheese omelette.<br/><br/>Another thing I loved about their breakfast is their vanilla shake.... and lots of lots of mushrooms... Boiled poached...  and Blueberry Danish,  Pineapple Struddle and Carrot Cake. (sweet tooth) üòÅ<br/><br/>LUNCH<br/><br/>Starters, salads and desserts. That's it. Main Course was good but not extra ordinary.<br/><br/>I loved Amritsari Fish, Chicken Baguette and Paneer Tikka served. Definitely couldn't miss on Hummus. It was good but not the best. There is this stir fry counter too. You can ask them to serve it (I came to know about it when I was full :( )<br/><br/>If you like to have Kadhai Paneer somewhat spicy, it can be disappointment. It's good but lacked that tangy spicy flavour.<br/><br/>I better not say anything about non veg main course. Not interested anymore to have them at restaurants when you can get best at home. <br/><br/>Their desserts are great. Don't mis them. I stuffed myself with three things - Fruit Crumble, Cheese Cake and Baked Yoghurt. <br/><br/>Please avoid sago pudding. It had very strong flavour of cinnamon.  If you love it then please. I was disappointed to waste one.<br/><br/>There are many other options one would love but I am gonna visit here for the selected things.",4.5

MoMo Cafe - Courtyard by Marriott,Sujana Krishnamoorthy,https://www.zoma.to/vreXye,"Went for a quiet family lunch on Rakshabandhan day (so not your usual workday lunch).<br/><br/>Disappointing....The starters, soup (carrot) with a wide variety of rolls/bread, Brinjal parmigiana were the highlights of the meal. Which isnt saying much for  buffet  for which you pay Rs 1200/ (there is a pay for one, one free offer on - which is a pity as it compromises on the quality of the food) <br/><br/>Other highlights: extremely average Chinese (I felt even a shaadi buffet might have done better taste wise), no pasta or pizzas, a wide variety of desserts - most just marking their presence.<br/><br/>All in all, one does expect better attention to detail as it is the Marriott :  cut fruit had mosquitos sitting on them , limp fries, pannacotta tasting off, ice cream had some crumbled cookies for topping (boring!)

MoMo Cafe - Courtyard by Marriott,Wasil,https://www.zoma.to/Dnxakk,"Is it just me ??¬†<br/>Sometimes when I take the first bite and even before the taste sense could hit the neurons on their way to my brain .. the realization kicks in  that there is nothing better in the whole wide world than a Mughlai Indian gosht. The food from the place, had my bite from has surely arrived and arrived big.<br/>This is what happened, with my first bite of Gosht Rizala the other day.<br/>The lamb was perfect, the gravy was perfect and the marrow oozing out was perfect. I shamelessly asked for a complementary bowl of curd and they gladly served. :)<br/><br/>This was day one.<br/><br/>I was lucky enough to get the chance of having a breakfast buffet and dinner buffet the next day.The breakfast had to be a lavish affair and it was, couldn't get my hands on a lot of things to be honest, was terribly occupied with office work. So, I literally had 2-4 bites of each<br/><br/>Breakfast No. 1<br/>Upma - which was delicious btw, Poha, bircher muesli (I never ever miss a chance to find one on a bountiful breakfast table, anywhere), sauted veggies with chicken sausage and corns and a little bread pakoda which again was fabulous.<br/><br/>Dinner -¬†<br/>A lot of people would say that not having a company can be tough sometimes, eating alone just doesn't feel good but I over the years, because of my travel, I have had my shares of lonely experiences and somehow have found the right balance to enjoy them. So, dinner was ""one man one table"" thing again.<br/>Started off with the salads, loved the tangy broccoli so much that I could have accidentally shortened their supply for the service .. jokes apart .. the salads gave my meal a perfect start with a bite each of the paneer chutney tikka,¬†chicken reshmi tikka and the fish starter. Paired the broccoli with kimchi to make it a killer combo in no time.<br/><br/>Did not have a lot in the mains to be honest but I should remember what all was there.<br/><br/>Hummus, baba ganoush, mint curd, Greek salad.<br/>Daal Palak, Achari Lamb, Gobhi Masala, Spicy Sabz Bahar<br/>Onion Rice, Biryani,¬†<br/>Curd and condiments to DIY raita (do it yourselves)<br/>There was a continental side of food too which was predominantly fish and I don't remember what was it exactly. :(<br/><br/>The food had to be fantabulous, but I felt that there was a bit of niggle with the hummus, it felt very salty and very grainy. Casually asked the server if it was just me or was it really under prepared. I forgot soon after and went back to my meal when Chef Saurabh came and to my utter surprise he admitted that the hummus was somehow lacking in a lot of things and was way too salty. They removed the hummus part from the salad table.<br/><br/>Now the desserts -<br/>Sour Cream Cherry Chantilly was the best of the best of the best ... captain.¬†<br/>Have never ever tasted such a light cream pudding like dessert, it was layered with flavours. Troubled to find the right combination of words right now to describe.¬†<br/>With the rest of them, I could see all my theoretical knowledge (coz of MasterChef and chopped and ++) coming to life, the sugary tuile and crumbly pastry and panna cotta and caramel custard and mud cake pudding and then the Indian part with baked gulab jamun and rose kheer. Perfection.<br/><br/>Breakfast 2<br/>Now this was a surprise, walked in to be told that it was complimentary ... Well, how good is that?<br/>And like a true Indian :) .. hearing free food I became hungry like Jughead and sunk in well to enjoy one thing at a time.<br/>This is an account once again - <br/>Started with my usual plate of fruits and a newer type of sprouts (malka daal i.e. whole red lentils) then a mixed parantha (aalu, gobhi, pyaaz) done lightly in desi ghee.¬†<br/>Egg whited typical Indian omelette was next (very well done, non-runny)<br/>My usual Bircher Muesli was replaced with strawberrry curd and blackberry curd for good.¬†<br/>A handful of mixed nuts and a bite of cold pastry finished it up.<br/><br/>Wow, this review has become more like an account book of what I ate. In the nutshell, whatever and where ever I grabbed I bite from MoMo cafe, everything was simply outstanding, which to be honest was really expected too.<br/><br/>A really humble ""Thank You"" to the chefs and the servers and the staff who have been tirelessly doing their job day after day .. which includes going to great lengths .. listening to everyone and be there for everything .. soaking all the good words and then the really shitty ones with the same ear to ear smile. This is pretty tough and that is why hospitality industry is considered to be the toughest one out there.<br/><br/>Hope to get back asap :)",4.5

Visited Momo cafe only because of such rave reviews and being a restaurant of an established chain.<br/>It is a big let down<br/>1. The first thing it will appear at best as a food court in a 3 star hotel. The food menu designed is just so wrong. The choice leaves baffled with no proper balance between vegetarian and non vegetarian dishes.<br/>2. The food ingredients are not upto mark, the bread ordered with soup and pasta was stale, the spring onions mature and with straw like texture, noodles sticky... so on<br/>3. Food lacks taste, no other word to say it. Bland is one thing, tastlesness is other.<br/>4. Absolute no sense of hygiene, the staff both chefs and servers need a big check on it. They will be cooking, wiping off on their uniform, touching ingredients bare hand so on and so forth,<br/>5. Servers are absent minded in terms of their table duty. They dnt know proper crockery, will forget spoon, or put the cutlery on the table directly, very slow in response and have no clue of service in hand.

Poppin' Deli,Priyansh A. Tiwari,https://www.zoma.to/YAnKkqe,"We are pure vegetarian people. We ordered a veg variant of Burrito bowl, and he literally served us Chicken and didn't even realise. It's when we noticed and asked them, they started making excuses. The waiter who goofed up with the order was so rude even in his apology and had no shred of remorse for SUCH A GRAVE MISTAKE. SHARADDH are going on, and we belomg to a pure vegetarian, pandit family. Eating, even thinking about having non veg food in front of us is a SIN. For us. How can they behave ao lightly about our religious belief and culture!!! On top of it , no solution or compensation was provided to us for the Issue, not even an apology. Just some random-ass excuse like ""we mixed the orders, THIS HAPPENS SOMETIMES. This was my first visit, and the last one as well.

However, this time my concern is not about taste, but about safety and health.<br/><br/><br/>Today, while eating butter chicken, I found a decorative stud-like stone in my gravy. If I hadn't noticed it while chewing, it could have easily hurt or worse, gone down into my stomach, which is very dangerous for anyone's health.<br/><br/><br/>I kindly request the restaurant to conduct a thorough inspection of their kitchen and ensure food safety measures are followed strictly.<br/><br/><br/>Before posting this review, I called the restaurant and informed them. They asked for an image of the object, which I am attaching here. While I am still giving 4 stars for taste and quantity, the safety issue is quite serious. I sincerely hope no other foreign objects make their way into the food, and I'm still in shock and in a hope that nothing entered my stomach while eating that gravy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Please make this a priority for the safety of your customers!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thank you and regards.<br/><br/>",4.0

We wait for 10-15 minutes in between starters to mains to finger bowl and bill. <br/>There is another serious problem that shouting in the kitchen disturbs you at this restaurant. We never experienced this during lunch , but during dinner it‚Äôs always complaining. We have asked the manager to keep the guy shouting at Kitchen to be quiet.<br/>Coming to food for which we went, the 3 stars are only because of their good and hygenic food. <br/>Panner Hyderabadi is a spicy main course dish which is must try.

Sanchi - Sayaji Hotel,Snuf The Commis Guy,https://www.zoma.to/bveMkl,"July 16th, Sunday 14:00 hours<br/><br/>Went to the Sayaji for the First time, as a celebration for my 3rd Rank! Parents were proud (I guess) and generous of of course, so we went ahead for Lunch at their Fine Dining Indian Restaurant, Sanchi.<br/><br/>The Restaurant was spacious, with an attached Corner Bar, and about 70 covers. Divided into 2 sections, The Restaurant had a very sooting ambiance, with yellow lights and charcoal black walls. The cutlery was a deep green and mud coloured.<br/><br/>Staff wore white shirts and black pants, and had a little knowledge about the menu. The server who tended to us had a bad odour from him as well. The menu provided to us had a missing page of thr Indian breads, and when we wanted another menu, the served started narrating the breads. It was a little awkward. I noticed there were no Napkins at the table and the fork I had wasn't proper and also, there was no cruet set on the table. Now considering that they tag themselves as ""fine dining"", these basic things were done wrong. Service here needs to be Improved big time.<br/><br/>The Menu was very confusing, some starters on the 1st page some on the 8th. They were printed on a laminated plastic, which felt cheap, contrary to their food prices.<br/><br/>Coming to the food, We had Shabnam Ke Moti, Veg Kolhapuri, Dal Tadka and Bread Basket. The food was Excellent! After being subjected to a very bad service, the food amazed me! Everything was freshly Prepared, Had a striking Flavor, with correct balance of Spices and delicious! Food talked about itself in my mouth. Great taste. Please click on the food pictures to know more about the food.<br/><br/>The place is pricey, service lacks it's charm but the food is delicious.

The ambience and service quality were poor and food was average.<br/>When we entered the restaurant, there was no manager/ valet at the entrance to guide us to the table and once we took a table, they came to tell us that it was reserved (though there was no tag that read ""reserved"" on the table.<br/>The cutlery kept on the table looked old and unclean. I had to ask the waiter to change it, which he did reluctantly.<br/>There were 2 napkins on the table of 4 persons. On being asked for napkins, the waiter got just one and we had to ask for the second one, which I think was stupid.<br/>We ordered Paneer Laziz, Murg Pashtun, Laccha paratha and butter naan. The food was average, however the laccha paratha was exceptionally hard to eat - totally not recommended.<br/>The food took long to come and I had to remind the waiter to get the meal, when he was merrily strolling in the restaurant <br/>All in all, would not recommend the restaurant for anyone who wants to enjoy good food and good time with family",1.0

In the main course we ordered sweet and sour vegetables with crispy noodles and cantonese rice which I didnt like much. There are variety of other dishes in both veg and non veg section but I have found more variety in sayaji indore. It is because it has newly opened here in bhopal.

The bites took a lot of time to reach us. It was almost 11 when we started the bland main course. The quantity served in relation to the price was average. The food did not taste great at all. We had to get 2-3 items changed twice or thrice. The non-veg meal had all bones and gravy in it. The entr√©e was somewhat better.

Their rich gravies were well infused with tomato and onion purees, albeit in varying proportions respectively. Topped with a swirl of cream and garnished with few chopped coriander leaves, the sabjis looked sumptuous and tasted excellent.<br/><br/>The accompanying Rotis, Stuffed Paratha and Kulcha were piping hot and uniformly cooked. Sans any butter smearing on top, the Tandoori Rotis were uniformly crisp. Owing to it's shiny surface, the butter smeared thick and circular Paratha looked awesome. It was stuffed with paneer and quite soft in texture. The Kulcha was stuffed with slightly spicy aloo-gobi mixture and neatly sliced into four quadrants.

The entire dish was sprinkled with chopped coriander leaves.<br/><br/>A small and round mound of decorative salad comprising of cabbage and carrot juliennes, thin onion roundels and lime was placed alongside.<br/><br/>The Paneer cubes were fresh and soft. The dish was good enough to be consumed as a Starter, as well as, to be paired with a Rice preparation or Kulcha. It was well seasoned and tasted excellent.<br/><br/>Though the dish was priced a wee bit on the higher side, but given the venue space and the service, it was kind of justified.<br/><br/>Price: Rs. 435/-<br/><br/>#vegfoodandreviews #vfr253 #pritypoddar #singleitemreview",4.0

Sanchi - Sayaji Hotel,AM,https://www.zoma.to/DKkbLR,"I will tell you how there was an insect floating on the mocktail I ordered but before that let me tell you how the same dinner turned out to be the most satisfying one. In this era of fine dining tradition Sanchi is a place which never fails to disappoint you. Sayaji after all these years remains fiercely beloved amongst diners. The Bhopal franchise lives upto the tradition. Located on Van Vihar road the surroundings are calm, green and lonely(at night). I must admit I was a little unnerved by the place at night. But once you enter the gates everything seems good. <br/><br/>The restaurant has a vivid setting with one intense golden shade of light dominanting the area. The hall is divided into two sections one with the bar and one away from it. Decorated with masterpieces and wooden furniture it gives you a feel of a contemporary fine dining restaurant. Moreover the amazing glasses used to serve water and the crockery adds to it. The music is just perfect and so is the ambience.<br/><br/>Being a decorated hotel the service is prompt. Staff is courteous and polite. Though on my third visit I experienced some lack of attentiveness from the staff. This time there was an insect in my mocktail which they changed without any questions. This shows how particular about the taste and quality of food. There is a particular policy of the hotel which I appreciate, they don't take tips. In short the hotel staff has been quite welcoming towards the guests. A few glitches here and there are acceptable.<br/><br/>The food menu is a blend of comprehensive Indian cuisine along with some variety of Chinese and Continental. The beverages menu is an elaborate affair with an interesting range of spirits and mocktails. Though most of the hard drinks are subject to availability. Spice girl was the mocktail I ordered, it was predominantly a khus flavored drink with a refreshing taste and signal green colour. The first course of my meal consisted of scrumptious Indian starter platter with Fish tikka, chicken tikka, sheekh kebab and prawns. The kebabs were succulent and delicious. Whereas crispy konjee lamb was burnt and shish kebab wasn't up to the mark. Coming to the main course the bread basket was an interested package of assorted Indian breads. Murg e Agan, prawn curry and murg pashtun are my personal recommendations. The meat was properly cooked and fresh. Gravy was rich and satisfying. Overall the food will always make me visit this place especially the Indian dishes. The price card is well in accordance with the quality of food and ambience.<br/><br/>To conclude I had a pleasant dining experience with food of the most exquisite flavours. For this reason and a comforting drive¬†I highly recommend going to¬†Sanchi for a family dinner.<br/><br/>",4.0

The Dal Karari was for sure the one that stood apart as well. Paneer Hyderabadi was just decent, however they can improve a lot on the breads they serve.

The service is not at all good , they kept us waiting for every starter and we had to request them to get the starters every time , really disappointed with their service and the ambience .

My family and I had the worst experience in this sub-standard restaurant. The food was served cold, the waiting staff had no idea about what items are available in the menu and they'd take 5 minutes to tell us that the item we've ordered is not available and this happened with 3 orders; incompetence of the highest order.<br/>Please do not go to this restaurant where they charge such high prices for coldly served food with amateurish servicing and management.",1.0

Sanchi - Sayaji Hotel,Neha Khandelwal,https://www.zoma.to/QZvKPQ,"Fine dining, luxury restaurant is exactly how anyone would define this place!<br/>They have taken the words 'atithi devo bhava' very very seriously, and anyone who visits will truly feel pampered like a king.<br/>The interiors are minimalistic and classy and you immediately get very comfortable in the environment. There is no crappy loud music playing in the backdrop or too much chaos from their staffs end. This place is a very smooth sailing ship and someday I would love to meet its Captain.<br/>The menu is extensive, covers a few different cuisines and has some very interesting dishes on it. Their drinks menu is equally good and I always tend to order the bartenders surprise drink because it is always a new but perfect drink to try.<br/>We have gone through the menu in the numerous visits and there have been very few things that we disliked and only because it did not match our taste buds. We have also on countless occasions requested for dishes that are not on the menu anymore and the new chef has been more than courteous by catering to our special requests.<br/>They had the most amazing tomato and basil soup, also a delightful and hearty bowl of spicy noodle broth, which are no more on their menu(heartbroken) also the best aglio-olio spaghetti which is again off their menu(but every time we request for it, we have been served this dish).<br/><br/>The thing to note, and kudos to the management for this is that they take care of and pay attention to every little single tiny minuscule detail! The water glasses are always filled before they get empty, they serve only mineral water and do not charge you for it. The dinnerware and silverware are always placed and replaced without you having to ask for it. They serve a fully loaded bread basket with their soups and never accept a tip on the bill because it includes a service charge(we were once followed all the way to the reception to have our exact change returned by a waiter).<br/><br/>What I would recommend:<br/>1. The crispy sweet corn : This is their signature dish. And nobody gets their crispy corn perfect the way they do.<br/>2. Tandoori chicken : Tastes perfect and the quality of the chicken always feels much more superior to other restaurants.<br/>3. The aglio-olio spaghetti : If you can talk the chef into prepping this dish for you then you are in for a delightful surprise.<br/>4. The dal khichdi : wholesome and pleasantly surprising. Definitely not home style and worth a try when you aren't in the mood for oily, over the top spicy food.<br/>5. The baked gulab jamun / blueberry cheesecake : All time favourite desserts here. I am not a gulab jamun fan but I have been told by my dinner entourage that it is perfect. And blueberry cheesecake here is my favourite!<br/><br/>Overall experience -<br/>Food 9/10<br/>Ambience 9/10<br/>Service 15/10 :)<br/>Cleanliness 10/10<br/>Price 9/10",5.0

Shahnama - Jehan Numa Palace,Sandip Ghose,https://www.zoma.to/woObeR,Always skeptical about multi-cuisine restaurants - Shahnama has always been a pleasant surprise probably because the hotel's base kitchens (both Indian and European) are so good. That local aristocratic families and not just tourists come there for meals is a great testimony for the place. Try it in the afternoons for lunch or even for breakfast and you would not regret it. Stick to the Indian (Mughlai or Hyderabadi) fare would be my suggestion.The best Haleem I have ever had outside of Hyderabad.

Shahnama is one of its restaurants.<br/><br/>I went there as I was informed of an ongoing food festival. The restaurant is well maintained. We had the buffet. A variety of starters were on display. From vegetarian to non vegetarian. From paneer to chicken. From mutton to fish. From egg to fruits. The starters side of the menu had it all. There were different kebabs and all of them tasted delicious. The main course was also spectacular. A wide range of dishes were present. A dish called 'firfosa' was the dish of the day for me. Shredded pieces of fried mutton. It was yumm. The desserts menu was also vast. A variety of pastries and mousse and ice creams were available. A preparation of 'lasoon ki kheer' was also made. Not a huge fan of garlic though. But an appropriate cherry on the top of a lavishing meal nonetheless. <br/><br/>Overall, one of the best restaurants in Bhopal. The service was one of the best I have seen. And would definitely visit again. :)",5.0

Shahnama - Jehan Numa Palace,Neha Jain,https://www.zoma.to/wlLqPE,"We had buffet lunch at Shahnama. The entrance to the hotel was impressive but the ambience of the restaurant was okay considering the 5-star hotel located at scenic view of the city.<br/><br/>Now about food, the Coriander soup served with bread was okay. Starters lacked variety as out of four, two were of paneer and other two tasted very similar. <br/><br/>Salads and other add on ingredients were just right with the spice and tanginess. <br/><br/>I loved the inclusion of Cheese & Crackers in the menu. <br/><br/>Main course was quite good with choices of vegetables.

Shahnama - Jehan Numa Palace,Tanushri Indoria,https://www.zoma.to/PPAMKX,"Shahnama, as the name suggests definitely gives you a ""Shaahi"" (Royal) treatment. This is a part of Jehan Numa Palace Hotel which serves you a grand stretch of buffet all year round. Breakfast buffet, lunch buffet and dinner buffet.<br/>I chose to go for a lunch buffet today. As soon as we entered the place, must say the staff is highly courteous. They make you feel welcomed, warm and extremely comfortable. Hospitality is what honestly makes Jehan Numa stand out from all the other hotels in this city.<br/>Ambience is royal and again very different from that of others. Their buffet stretch was huge - from soups to various kinds of bread, a cheese platter, salads, deviled eggs, dahi badas, veg and non veg kebabs, veg and non veg tikkas, Chinese and Thai section of gravies and noodles, baked counter, pasta counter, two kinds of rice, veg and non veg gravy vegetables, types of naans and rotis and a dessert counter.<br/>Presentation is really good. It tempts you to eat.<br/>Well, I tried eating the maximum dishes so that I could give a proper review.<br/>HOT & SOUR SOUP was actually brilliant. Why did I say so? It's because mostly when served hot and sour the soup is way too hot. The black pepper used is way too much and gives ones throat a bad time. Rather here one could taste the hotness of the soup with the sweetness of the veggies and gave peace to ones throat. Moving on to the SALAD COUNTER had WATERMELON AND FETA which was brilliant, CORN SALAD which was accompanied with green bell peppers and lemon juice, tomato and red chilly powder and did taste good, HOMEGROWN LETTUCE SALAD and this is one of the best, juiciest, fresh lettuce I have had, ROASTED CHICKEN SALAD which was scrumptious to the core. The chicken pieces were roasted to perfection with little spices and brilliant. Moving to the main course their DAL FRY was finger licking good, with perfect amount of tadka. TOMATO RICE was average, nothing different or special about it. PANEER LAZIZ had soft and tender pieces of paneer cooked in tomato, cream and cashew gravy which was extremely rich in taste. KELE KI SUBZI was something unique, which generally people fear cooking is because if not cooked well, the combination of spices and bananas give an extremely bad taste. It wasn't bad, quite bland and highly plain in taste still couldn't make me love this vegetable and add on to my favorite list. JUNGLEE MAAS was something I had for the first time and was quite spicy, so people who love spicy food-it should be your pick. BABYCORN CIGARS were dipped in batter and deep fried and gave sweet and sour taste all together and was one of the good starters. MUSHROOM STRONGANOFF was something which took my heart. Creamy and rich in taste, the mushrooms were covered in thick creamy red gravy. CHICKEN LEHSUNI TIKKA was good but not something I haven't tasted before. It did taste quite common. CHICKEN METHI TIKKA was extremely tasty. The best I have had till date. The chicken pieces were marinated well in spices and methi leaves and they were juicy and tender enough to melt in your mouth. Simply loved it.<br/>One should have a developed taste/taste buds for fishes and various kinds of cheese. I tried the Hunan fish and smoked cheese for the first time. The fish even after being cooked had a very strong smell. The SMOKED CHEESE had a pungent taste and gave a hint of bitterness as soon as you swallow it. So, go for these two only if you wish to build your taste buds or already have developed ones.<br/>Let's move on and satiate our sweet tooth-<br/>CHOCOLATE MOUSSE- Soft, perfect, melting and brilliant.<br/>BROWNIE- Filled with dates, nuts and a base of crumbs was one of the best.<br/>COOKIE DOUGH PASTRY- Dressed with chocolate and baked with chocolate chips was again tasty.<br/>BAKED CURD- Baked curd had a little sour taste with <br/>sweetness of fruits, something different and nice.<br/>MOONG DAL HALWA- It was nice.<br/>CARAMEL CUSTARD- Well, they never go wrong with it.<br/>By the way, the lunch buffet is Rs. 899/- + 16% taxes on weekdays and Rs. 999/- + 16% taxes on weekends.<br/>IT'S TOTALLY WORTH IT.",4.5

Shahnama - Jehan Numa Palace,Chaahat,https://www.zoma.to/znQqBw,"Went to Shahnama with lot of hopes. However, the entire experience was just above average on a relative scale. <br/>Ambience: 9/10 (Overlooking the lawns of Jehan Numa, the restaurant is shinning bright with natural daylight. There was a group of semi-classical singers which just made the overall atmosphere lively. Shahnama gets a thumbs up for a family friendly relaxing ambience)<br/>Service: 6/10 (Service gets a low score on relative scale for Shahnama. Generally, from a restaurant of this repute, you expect a personalised and smiling service. However, that's not the case with Shahnama. Servers were just courteous enough to take your order, there was some bit of confusion also with respect to table numbers and nobody bothered to serve food into our plates. Well, not expected from Shahnama. Still, there's nothing so negative about service, it's just that, Shahnama wasn't up to rather high expectations on this front.)<br/>Food: 9/10 (We decided to go for a la carte and straightaway ordered paneer pasanda and punjabi channa with stuffed naan and curd. The paneer was so rich with dry fruits and flavourful thick gravy. It was sufficient for two of us and we really enjoyed our meal. Similarly, the chole were well cooked with delightful aroma. The naan was also well cooked and was good piping hot. So the food totally overshadowed the not so good service experience and earns the points for Shahnama)<br/>Price: Approx 2000rs for two including taxes. This is for a la carte limited lunch",4.0

Shahnama - Jehan Numa Palace,Bhupinder,https://www.zoma.to/ZAXlkx,"Scumptious Dinner Buffet !! Shahnama the Jehanuma palace Hotel<br/>STARTERS<br/>Large varieties for the Non vegetarians less for the vegetarians<br/>Taste was average !! Staff doesnt describe the starter dishes while serving them on table<br/><br/>MAINCOURSE<br/><br/>This is the place if you want the perfect artistic north Indian Gravies with immense varieties for vegetarian this place will remain the best main course place in the town if you are up for a buffet.<br/><br/>They had Combination of Indian thai and chinese items on the platter.<br/><br/>Gravies like Malai tinda were unique and something very few have heard of absolutely marvelous cant even name one gravy which failed to impress us . Dal Makhani, Kadhai paneer, Hariyali methi kofta curry with some italian dishes were absolutely mind boggling plus the Rajasthani touch of Dal baati churma cooked in earthen pot over chulha was something not many places wud provide u.<br/>DESSERT<br/><br/>They had around 10 varieties of dessert my personal favourite was Beetroot ka halwa something very unique which i have never really tasted in life. 3 varities of Icecreams were pleasant for the taste buds as well.<br/>Food - 4/5 just for the maincourse as starters u can get better in other places like Kebabsville in Bhopal<br/>Ambiance 3/5 just because space was narrow although it had the palace kind of feel but an open restaurant would have been better anyday.<br/><br/>Price was 1300/- inclusive of taxes for veg on a weekday which was little overpriced by almost 300 bucks you won't like to pay for such buffet more than 1000.<br/>",4.0

Shahnama - Jehan Numa Palace,Sabyasachi Roy,https://www.zoma.to/XkBLdl,"Visited this place many a times. The wonderful memories I used to have at this place is now totally gone.<br/><br/>Shahnama used to serve wonderful variety of salads (Indian, Mughal, Continental, etc.). This whole scrumptious variety has totally gone as they stopped serving it the way they previously used to.<br/><br/>Secondly the taste has also gone hell down and they also serve you leftover dishes of previous buffet which I caught them while having the Devilled Eggs Salad & Chicken Noodle Salad which was so dry and stinky. When I pushed them to serve me fresh the difference was drastically visible.<br/><br/>In short, If someone really want to ruin their special day this is the perfect place for it.<br/><br/>Final Say, ""Apne pet pe kulhadi maarni hai to zaroor jaaye.""<br/><br/>‚ô°Peace‚ô°",2.0

The warmth and desire to attend to each & every guest does make the hospitality department purely World-class!!! Don't forget the Shammi Kebabs & Yes,the succulent chicken cooked in Kali Mirch...The post dinner walk in the premises with a pleasant nip in the air wrapped up in Pashmina does make this place a must-visit if you are in The City Of Lakes!!!",4.0

I opted for Ala carte and had vegetable kothe, Masaleydaar choley, dal shahnama and roomali roti. Everything was better than I expected. Quantity of food did justice to the price. It's a little heavy on pockets. Staff is great. They are polite, well trained and courteous. I had a great evening at Shahnama, would highly recommend to visit this place.",4.5

The breakfast buffet was elaborate and the items on the menu were well thought of. However it did not leave me spellbound; so the breakfast buffet gets a 4/5 .<br/>Coming to their lunch buffet; it was truly impressive with some mouth-watering food!! They had so much variety (whatever you can think of was there in the buffet - be it the main course, salad, starters, soup, dessert). It was arranged perfectly and tasted amazing; so this certainly deserves a 5/5! Ambience wise the place makes you feels warm and comfortable, overall a fine dining experience.",4.5

Shahnama - Jehan Numa Palace,Sujana Krishnamoorthy,https://www.zoma.to/rAyDEd,"When we ate at Shahnama a year ago, the food was average. We were disappointed. Pleasantly surprised to see that the food has vastly improved now. Had the dinner buffet with friends and family earlier this week. <br/><br/>Great salad counter, imaginatively presented. Loved the shot glasses with achaari mooli!<br/><br/>One of the nice things about the buffet  is that the Chinese/Thai station was not just an 'also ran' but provides a good alternative to the Indian counter with starters and main courses. Much appreciated!<br/><br/>Chef at live roti/naan station turned out a very good aloo kulcha on request.<br/><br/>Dessert counter had great choices: baked yogurt and papita halwa standing out.<br/><br/>The restaurant was soon packed by 9 pm so good idea to reserve a table. Just one suggestion: might be a good idea to lay out cutlery (dessert and other spoons) at a couple of places so we didn't have to keep asking and waiting for the (busy) staff to give us fresh ones.<br/><br/>My rating is: the best buffet in town just now. A tad expensive at Rs 1200/ per head (including taxes) but your go to place for a celebration definitely!<br/><br/>The challenge would be to keep this up, Team Jehanuma!",4.0

The resort feeling of the hotel is simply amazing. I must have been to this place at least 10 times over the last few years.<br/><br/>The menu is extensive, replete with numerous varieties. Furthermore, the food added up to the grandeur of this place. The place had an Indian touch of stalls for serving the starters.

For the main course, I tried Paneer, Kofta, and Dhabe¬†ki Dal, which were all lip smacking.¬†<br/><br/>The staff is hospitable.¬†I just wish that their staff is much more accommodating in our requests than they are - esp when you are one of the priciest restaurants in the town and we are a regular customer.",5.0

I personally recommend this place for a dinner. For me it was (is) just outstanding. It also has waiting cum play area and also a private dining space ( to be booked before).<br/>The food will take you to another level of experience. I tried barbecue cheese potatoes, baked cheese and chicken parcels and baked cheese pasta (restaurant special for the night).

There were quite a lot of options available like aloo tikki, papdi chaat, Palak pakoda, gol guppe etc. The starters were limited but delicious.

Under The Jamun Tree,Mudra Keswani,https://www.zoma.to/vGlkzL,"As the weekend slips through, commencing a new week with a lazy Sunday morning, you might happen to skip breakfast. To chase down those mid morning hunger pangs, a perfect Sunday Brunch is what will set the right mood for the day. So if you have no plans for your Sunday afternoons head to Under the Jamun Tree at Jehan Numa Retreat for an elaborate Sunday brunch. <br/><br/>With a refreshing view over lush green lawns, Jehan Numa Retreat is the place to start the perfect Sunday with a delectable and exquisite brunch. Guests have a plethora of choices, including live grills, unlimited drinks and a lavish buffet spread. <br/><br/>Sunday brunches at Jehan Numa Retreat is a destination in itself. Bathed in the winter sun, Under the Jamun Tree's alfresco dinning is Bhopal‚Äôs best destination for a pleasant and relaxing Sunday afternoon while sipping your favourite drink with not a worry in the world and nowhere to rush to. <br/><br/>As soon as I entered the restaurant I was welcomed with drinks and Street Food live station standing right at the entrance. Typical Indian Chat Theela serving mind boggling Chats such as Dahi Puri, Pani Puri Shots, Chole Tikki, Papdi Chat etc. While the other live stations had international cuisine such as Burritos and Omelette with Romesko Sauce. <br/><br/>Salads: The salads and cold cuts are my favourite way to start on a buffet and Jehan Numa Retreat does not disappoint in both. I started with Cesar Salad, a salad of romaine lettuce and croutons dressed with parmesan cheese, lemon juice, olive oil, Worcestershire sauce, anchovies, garlic, and black pepper. Some other salads worth trying are Spring Pea, Pepper & Goat Cheese and Sprouts Salad. <br/><br/>Drinks: What is a brunch without some good drinks? Often the onset of making a brunch a success lies equally on the shoulders of the bartender as it does on the chef. <br/><br/>The bar tender presented its Signature Drink named Retreat Lime Cooler and Blue Lagoon. The Retreat Lime Cooler was made with Cranberry juice fresh lime and Soda. The real essence was the mix of flavours that came out really well. Blue Lagoon, was made with Blue Syrup, crushed ice and limca. If you wish to consume alcohol, you can try the varieties of Mojitos, Martini's or can go in for Single Malts or beer. <br/><br/>The Mediterranean Spread included some really good pita bread and all of the classic dips of tabbouleh, baba ghanoush, hummus. <br/><br/>Starters: My favourite part of the brunch is starters. A few things you can look forward to are: <br/><br/>Green Peas Veloute Shots, Cheese Olive Pineapple stick, Acchari Paneer Tikka & Tandoori Sabzi:<br/><br/>The kebabs are cooked using high temperatures in the tandoor which is a traditional clay pot heated with coal fire. The flavours which emerge are a delicious combination of smoky yet subtle while the textures are rich, soft and succulent. Good on taste and made to perfection. <br/><br/>Main Course: <br/><br/>Palak Paneer ke Kofte: Fried Spinach Dumpling Balls cooked in thick tomato gravy.  Cottage cheese balls surrounded by spinach roundels gives a very eye pleasing look to a dish. A must try for vegetarians.<br/><br/>Rajasthani Gatta Curry: Rajasthan cooking in general has its own unique flavour where the simplest and the most basic of ingredients go into the preparation of delicious dishes. The bold spices & flavours are enough to take you back to Rajasthan. <br/><br/>Alloo Gobi Adraki: A ginger flavoured vegetable recipe, Alloo Gobi Adraki has the just right flavour of ginger embedded in the cauliflowers and potatoes. <br/><br/>Baigan Methi: Sometimes it is magical how even simple ingredients can be transformed into splendid delicacies by using the right combinations and methods. In the Baingan Methi ki Subzi, the humble brinjal combines with methi and indian spices makes it a scrumptious dry subzi. <br/><br/>Dal Panchrattan: A delightful combination of five dals, simmered with aromatic spices. The Dal Panchrattan gets the right amount of tanginess from curd and tomatoes, which complements the spiciness very well.<br/><br/>Masala Pulav: The rice was cooked on low flame and therefore the aroma & strong flavours along with spices did the magic. <br/><br/>Dessert:<br/><br/>No better way to end the feast with exquisite and alluring desserts, which were handcrafted to perfection. <br/><br/>Mini Cup Cakes: These cute looking Chocolate & Vanilla Cupcakes had butter cream frosting and were served in earthenware bowls . <br/><br/>Coffee Mousse: Served in a Cutting Chai Glass!! Chocolate mousse is for those who like the sweet and indulgent smell of cocoa, while this mousse is for those who love the rich, invigorating aroma of coffee. This was one dreamy dessert. The rich aromatic flavours of Coffee is an absolute hit for the taste buds. <br/><br/>Tough I was a little disheartened with the variety of bakery items. But, chef mentioned that with time they're going to include many more desserts. <br/><br/>Paan & Gulkand Phirni: This dessert is a twist to the traditional phirni. It is gulkand flavoured infused with Pan patta's (betel leaf) fresh smell. Wonderful light dessert that won't let you feel bloated!	<br/><br/>Some other desserts worth trying are: Malpua with Rabri and Moongdal Halwa.<br/><br/>Few things I would like to see at this brunch: More variety of cuisines. :)<br/><br/>Happy Hogging!<br/><br/>Pricing: The brunch is priced at INR - 1,099 (Non Alcoholic) & INR - 1,399 (Alcoholic) . (Unlimited Food & Beverages) <br/><br/>Timings: 1 PM to 5 PM every Sunday.",4.0

The place has an Indian touch of stalls for serving the starters like chaat, kebabs, kathi rolls, pizza, pasta etc. The grills are placed right behind and visible. All starters are served on table and are ensured to reach in time. I had tried almost everything.. bhel, papdi chaat, special request dahi puri, pani puri, chicken egg roll which I personally found best for the day, black pepper white sauce pasta, NV pizza, grilled chicken kebab, fish fingers, mutton kebab (not v great), paneer tikka, hara bhara kebab, veg seekh kebab apart from blue ocean / ice tea as welcome drink which I replaced with lemonade ! I didn't touch salads that day!<br/>After this much I strictly wasnt in a mode to eat main course! I had a small portion of green thai curry and steamed rice which was v nicely made. Their mutton biryani had been done in dum style. I was loaded with food by then. But I'm sure it was a good deal. The other main course spread included taar gosht, chicken korma, veg korma, aloo katli, paneer masala and breads. <br/>Desserts have been a good spread. The serving for the day being avocado flavor vanilla nitrogen ice-cream apart from the bakery desserts - cup cakes, pastries, coffee chocolate mousse, chocolate truffle, blueberry mousse, caramel custard, Indian desserts - gajar halwa which was a real delight n rawa payesh served in earthen bowl.

Under The Jamun Tree,Sach,https://www.zoma.to/OkkOpP,"You want to visit a resort which has a jungle resort feel within the city limits.....this is your spot. A quaint resort located right next to Van Vihar National Park and across the Upper Lake is set up with cottages and open air restaurant. <br/><br/>Under the Jamun Tree has a beautiful setting with tiki torches, lanterns setting up the mood. Rustic wooden furniture on Gravel laden outdoor area with a huge Jamun Tree in the middle (hence the name of the restaurant). The Main Kitchen is hidden behind the huge bushes but the Tandoor area and Grill section is set up in the open, on clay finished village style counters. <br/><br/>The service is outstanding. Staff is very courteaous and they make sure that you leave the place happy. <br/><br/>Watermelon juice and the Cucumber Cooler was not good though. Juice seemed as if it was not made with fresh watermelon....where as the cooler lacked Ice, flavour and body.<br/><br/>The maincourse was very well flavoured and served with love. Hare Mirch ka Keema was amazing. The flavours of Green chilli was just apt. You could taste the real green chillies but the hotness was just enough that enhanced the  the flavours of the well cooked Mutton Keema. Bhopali Murgh Rizala on the other hand was very subtly flavoured and garnished beautifully with boiled egg. Accompanied with Roomali Roti and Bakhakani (especially made on our request) the meal was perfect. <br/><br/>No good meal is complete without a good dessert to end it. So we decided on calling the dessert to our room. Our choice was Chocolate Ganache. To me it was a disappointment. The Ganache was more like a mousse with an overdose of mint which made it bitter.  And at a price point of 400++ for a shot glass of Mint Mousse it was not a good preperatio at all.",4.0

Under The Mango Tree - Jehan Numa Palace,Shubhorup Biswas,https://www.zoma.to/pvkEmY,"During the holidays at Bhopal, I discovered a long lost friend unearthing him after 34 long years! While our respective shapes and sizes underwent a whole lot of mutations, the bonhomie never faded over time. My friend hosted me an excellent dinner at the restaurant, 'Under the Mango Tree' on a leisurely Sunday evening for a journey down the memory lane. The ambiance and food enticed me for a repeat visit to the restaurant next day with six of my family members.¬†<br/><br/>On entering Jehan Numa Palace of 19th. century vintage and crossing over the plush hotel lobby, we located the aptly christened restaurant, 'Under the Mango Tree' with an ancient mango tree as its company. The restaurant is open on all sides with a provision to extend dining arrangements in the lawns around during more agreeable climes. We settled inside the covered area and truly fell for the environs. The wicker furniture, muted lighting in the eating area and a gently gurgling fountain in the lawns all added to the ambiance.¬†<br/><br/>While some of us chose the hard drinks (specific brands on promotion at 50% discount), two of us went for mocktails (Rs.250/- each). A portion of 'murgh malai tikka' (Rs.565/-) was lapped up as the starter. Our main courses comprised a portion each of 'murgh biryani' (Rs.480/-), dal tadka (Rs.260/-), mix vegetables (Rs.300/-), 'nihari gosht' (Rs.615/-) along with tandoori rotis (Rs.50/- apiece). For dessert, we asked for vanilla ice cream with hot chocolate (Rs.280/-), chocolate mousse (Rs.300/-) and brownies with ice cream (Rs.325/-). Chicken tikka was quite pricey but tasted good. Chicken biryani, cooked in Awadhi style was rich with aroma and served in quantity enough to cater to two persons. We also enjoyed the mutton nihari, prepared in Old Delhi mughlai cooking style. Dal tadka and mix veg were nothing to write home about.¬†<br/><br/>Jehan Numa Palace would score very high for the ambiance but its top dollar pricing for the quality of food served makes it little overrated.",4.0

I would mention some which can be devoured heartily. In starters, Rajma Galouti kebab, Palak Chilkoze ki Tikki, Hara Bhara Kabab, Paneer Subz tikka could be the best choices. For the Main course: Paneer Pasanda, Kadhi Pakoda, Hyderabadi Veg Biryani. Totally contended! heavenly food! Would like to come again!<br/><br/>Ambiance: 5/5<br/>Food: 5/5<br/>Service: 4/5",5.0

Under The Mango Tree - Jehan Numa Palace,Mayur Joshi,https://www.zoma.to/QEqzGd,While the menu overlaps with the Shahnama situated in the same premises; the food which we tried out was on an average to good scale. We tried the Dungar ghost kebab; which while being extremely succulent; had a taste of spices undercooked. The smoky flavor was also missing or probably the spices overpowered them. The Dal Shahnama ; although creamy and well cooked; dint have the oomph factor associated with overnight cooked dals( ref: Dal Bukhara)..

Under The Mango Tree - Jehan Numa Palace,Food-inr,https://www.zoma.to/qzBaoM,"Jehan Numa Palace - A Heritage destination Hotel in The City of Lakes, Bhopal. The Mango Tree is basically located under a longstanding mango tree in the central patio. This is mainly known for Barbeque and starters. Basically I visited with lots of high expectations after hearing a lot from my friends and family members. But, there is no such ambiance at this place, so don‚Äôt raise your expectations before going. It‚Äôs very simple place near a mango tree and a fountain, which may made them bit rich in terms of location. Partially situated on a hill and Yes, here valet parking is available. :D<br/>As a complimentary, they offer White & Garlic Bread with Amul Butter, bread soup sticks & peanuts. In the appetizer, we started with barbeque Veg platter of all the starters. It had baked potato, grilled Paneer, stuffed tomato, Bell peppers, some carrot, cucumber, Lettuces, onions, hara bhara kahab, etc. The taste was nice, but could have been better. One can also try Baked Aloo (I don‚Äôt remember the exact name) which also looked bit attractive to me.<br/><br/>In the main course, we had daal tadka and Dum Aloo Kashmiri. It was served with Red gravy which was okay. Daal Tadka was very good. <br/><br/>In the breads, we had Tandori Roti and Butter Naan. It looked good but was all cold and became sticky. This was because just after serving platter, they served main course within some minutes. After requesting manager, they replaced 3/4th of the overall bread order. With such a known hotel, they don‚Äôt even know when to serve what? This was not at all expected from high class palace. <br/>Hospitality ‚Äì 2.5/5 Not up to the expectations. I think they should hire some more staff so that they can server every table. It looked like there were only 3-4 staff members including manager who was available in the lawn. You may need to call them again and again for water or extra order, by calling HEY! HEY! Which was a complete disappointment.<br/>Cost ‚Äì Expensive as compared to the hospitality received. It would come around 800-1000/person. Quality of food ‚Äì 4/5Overall - A nice pleasant place with not much show-off. :-) I would give them 4/5. Recommended.",4.0

Under The Mango Tree - Jehan Numa Palace,Anshitaa Sabherwal,https://www.zoma.to/oOBeEP,"My experience at Under The Mango Tree was a classic case of disappointment served cold. Having been a patron of Jehan Numa since I was born (not even exaggerating), the fact that I had never visited this restaurant until last week, strikes as slightly odd. <br/>Anyhow, we made our reservations for a big family celebration (party of 16) on a weekday. We started off on a bad note with our soups being served lukewarm and low on seasoning.  The salt and pepper shakers salvaged what was salvagable and we patiently waited for our appetizers. <br/>So personally for me, the murg malai tikka at Jehan Numa is the holy grail of all murg malai tikkas, for me. And what we were served didnot disappoint. Tender, succulent, creamy and perfectly flavoured, we couldn't get enough of it. <br/>The fish tikka again was disappointing and low on flavours. What surprised me was that they managed to get their paneer tikka wrong. It was absolutely bland and lifeless. <br/>For mains, we ordered the dal makhni which was nothing to write home about. The mutton nihari was practically a serving of meat floating in oil. It broke my heart, putting this food in my tummy. A certain fish curry we ordered though was pretty delicious and I recommemd it (I cannot recollect the name but the servers will be happy to recommend).<br/>Service was good, nothing over the top. The ambience is chill and apt for a relaxed dinner. <br/>Although I would battle the storms and wage wars for their murg malai tikka, I don't believe I will be visiting this restaurant anytime in the near future.",2.0

And there has been a consistentcy in one or the other complaint with regard to food.<br/>The last time I saw people in waiting was during the tourism day when it offered 50% off on food.<br/>If you really want to go, dinner is most suitable. Not only the place has the best view in the city, infront of the lake and gleaming lights of the vehicals passing over the vip road, the scenic beauty is accompanied by cool water body breeze at night. It also has live performances by some upcoming artists, who are pretty good.<br/>However, my main concern is regarding the food. Honestly, I never liked any soup. Be it clear or manchow or cream or even tomato, or veg or nonveg, my tastebuds never allowed me to take another gulp apart from understanding the flavour of what actually has been served!<br/>Starters are average. Chinese is average. Indian is average. Vegetarian main course is little below average. Non vegetarian main course is average.

Wind And Waves,Dheer Ledwani,https://www.zoma.to/lqzgGM,"Superb ambiance. Live music is cherry on the cake especially when weather is nice. Great place to spend time with close friends and family.<br/><br/>However the food is a big let down.Also the prices are way high when compared to the taste, quality and quantity.<br/>3 stars only for the setup.",3.0
Wind And Waves,Shubhendra Singh,https://www.zoma.to/KvrdZq,"If there was an award to be handed out to restaurant only on the basis of location wind n waves would get that one for sure in the city of bhopal. But, they seriously need to improve a lot in terms of their food and service. There service is damn slow and food is just above average in taste according to me. Some restraunts like baapu ki kutia in mp nagar or vrindavan dhaba serves better food at much cheaper rates than this mediocre place. 2.5 stars only for the scenic view and the feeling it gave me while having average food.",2.5
Wind And Waves,Deepak Rawat,https://www.zoma.to/QdNlpb,"One of the best foodie restaurant in bhopal..the view from restaurant is awesome..the food is awesome..specially veg kothe,fish tikka,tandoori chicken .. Everytime i visit bhopal this place is in the top of my list..must visit after 7 PM you will love it..",5.0
Wind And Waves,Alin Choubey,https://www.zoma.to/DnDbry,"kay so this place have always been in the list of a Bhopal Visitor or Bhopali all because of our very own Lake üòä and the mesmerising view. Its the USP of this place.<br/>This is operated by State Tourism Department, so the standard and quality are below norms. Not even H of Hospitality, so please don't go with the expectations.<br/>The dishes aren't going to please you. They are all Okayish.<br/>So why visit there when the food isnt good and Service is next to nil??<br/>The answer is the view, its totally worth it!<br/>And if you consume alcohol,they have a Bar on the first floor.<br/>That will be one of the most satisfying booze you will ever have even if you don't have company.<br/>In the monsoons this place gets amazing.<br/>Very romantic if you are on a date, PS again food will disappoint.<br/>In the summers though please prefer indoor sitings.",3.0
Wind And Waves,Ketki Kulkarni,https://www.zoma.to/ygZKXG,"The only exotic-ness this place holds is the view it provides.<br/>The taste is not bad at all, but the food is unreasonably expensive.<br/>Everyone says the service is slow, but of course in a place like this you wouldn't want to just get everything fast and then leave. This is where you'd want to sit, relax and enjoy the view.<br/>Save for their prices, this could really be a good place.",3.0
Wind And Waves,Mummazkid,https://www.zoma.to/vAgmYO,"The restaurant is very popular because of the lovely view of lake , where u will definitely get to feel winds and view of waves. . . <br/>Visited many time before .. last visited on 1/01/2018 the restaurant was crowded as it was  new year .. the food is decent with decent price .. <br/>About the taste : not mouthwatering but can satisfy your taste bud.<br/>Service : excellent 5/5 if you know how to treat the waiters. <br/>Overall must visit place for if u are #bhopali...or living in Bhopal.",4.5
Wind And Waves,Piyush Parashar,https://www.zoma.to/BXXZZe,"Has nothing to offer except the view of the lake. Typical sarkaari service: arrogant, slow & tardy. Needlessly expensive rates for such mediocre food. Best avoided.",1.5
Wind And Waves,Harday Gupta,https://www.zoma.to/qkOzbz,"The rating is only for the lake view, else the food is just ok. The worst thing is, they won't have stock of common alcohol. When we visited this place they have only kingfisher strong in beer and nothing else. Also, after serving one large peg of Black Dog they simply said 'Sir wo to khtam ho gyi koi aur dekhlo warna beer pilo'. Who says like this?<br/><br/>The ambiance was also ok ok types. They seriously need to improve the quality.",2.5
Wind And Waves,Abhishek Singhal,https://www.zoma.to/BEeDnn,"It wasn't even a worthwhile experience. This restaurant is mp tourism owned which explains why. Granted it's at a picturesque location but everything else from food, serving staff, ambience, even the furniture stinks. Big time! I was apalled to find plastic chairs inside the restaurant. The whole restaurant bore the look of a second grade banquet hall. Food, uh! Horrendous. Waiters have government job so they were least bothered about promptness or even using serving trays. And it's costly. Burns a hole in your heart to be honest, lol! If you still want to eat out here, i'd suggest go for dinner. During lunchtime you'll be more focused at waves of garbage in upper lake. 1.5 stars because atleast we got free parking :-P",1.5
Wind And Waves,Aniket Chiniwalla,https://www.zoma.to/EyMMQB,"I see a lot of people commenting on the deteriorating quality of food, but let me be honest. There are quite a few items which taste good when compared to other places. The USPs of this place are the location, ambiance and service. I visit this place nearly 2-4 times a year since 2010, and I have enjoyed my each visit to the place. I agree there are times when the service is really slow but the place gets crowded quickly too!¬†<br/>For me, this is one of the must visit places in Bhopal after Top n Town ice-creams!",5.0
Wind And Waves,Sahiba,https://www.zoma.to/yYwQgD,"The place is so beautiful, you visit there. Enjoy the beauty. Look at menu- quite high price. Still you want to give a try- you order coffee, sandwiches, chhole kulcha (when I visited there, it was on menu as wind and waves special) and few more starters. Wait for eternity to get it served and when you have the first bite you regret taking right turn not left. <br/><br/>You actually do this several times, hoping for some improvement. But only improvement you find is in the scenary. Well there was improvement in service when I last visited there.<br/><br/>Giving 2 for location, 1 for chhola kulcha, which were actually good (could be accidentally) but yes they were good in quantity as well as taste.<br/><br/>What a good bar can do for teetotaller? Nothing!!!",3.0
Wind And Waves,Rohit,https://www.zoma.to/nqLnXO,"Location of the restaurant, what should I say the best location in city to have a perfect dine , service is good and its quite really fast , the taste is excellent we had chicken tikka which was very good , some famous liquor brands are here with a live musical performance and rate of are also also not high , I recommend all of you to give a try over there ,who has has not tasted f&b of there",4.5

Wind And Waves,Atul Kumar,https://www.zoma.to/pvXNEwm,"They have somehow managed to destroy probably the best location for any restaurant in Madhya Pradesh. The food is pathetic, staff is Sarkari level rude and can someone please stop the live music there. We have some good memories of Wind and waves from way back in 2008-12. It used to be one of the best restaurants in Bhopal. Gradually the restaurant has degraded to ordinary and then pathetic. Now even the best view can not compensate for really bad service and poor food. Sadly people will keep going there and keep on being disappointed. Such a waste of the most beautiful property in probably our country. <br/>",1.0
Wind And Waves,Ar Shivam Kashyap,https://www.zoma.to/EXdYKN,"Definitely worth sitting outside and on upper deck--- lovely view of the lake and city at night.

Wind And Waves,Saswat Paul,https://www.zoma.to/oBAbDx,"Stunning view, coupled with amazing food and prompt service makes this restaurant one to revisit. Comfortable metal chairs, with the sun falling on our shoulders made for a warm and inviting ambience. <br/>We had ordered Mutton Biryani, Tandoori Roti, Bhuna Gosht and Sweet Lime Sodas. The Biryani, though not the best I've had, was quite good, and was served in an adequate amount. The Bhuna Gosht, an Afghani styled mutton dish, prepared in the Hydrabadi style, was finger-licking good. The Lime Sodas, however, were a bit on the sweeter end of the spectrum, opposed to my preference of a more balanced taste; but that's just me being a nitpicker. <br/>It's definitely a personal suggestion of mine.",4.0
Wind And Waves,Prateek Saxena,https://www.zoma.to/bZDxmE,The only good thing about this place is its location and no other restaurant in bhopal can beat that. Bt that is it. Everything else was a complete let down. Food took years to reach to our table and it tasted not as good as it should have been considering the premium price. On talking to their 'not so friendly' staff i came to know that this restaurant is managed by mp tourism and then felt even worse about the quality. This place has the most potential to become the best in the city with all the resources too in hand but still it is this bad.,2.0

Mutton Gaualti kebab, Mutton biryani and Nihari...not sure which one was rhe best. Nihari was carefully cooked so that the Mutton was melting in the mouth.
